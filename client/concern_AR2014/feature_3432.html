        <h2>18 STAFF RETIREMENT LIABILITIES</h2>

<p>The group and company operate different staff retirement arrangements for three main categories of staff; staff based in Ireland and the UK, national staff based in overseas countries of operation and ex-staff who receive benefits due to incapacitation related to their work with Concern.</p>

<p>The current schemes are as follows:</p>
<p><strong>(1)  Defined contribution pension scheme</strong> - which is open to all current ROI &amp; UK staff
<br><strong>(2)  Defined benefit pension arrangements :</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (a)  Defined benefit pension scheme - pre 1993 pension scheme for ROI and UK staff employed at that time
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (b)  Overseas local staff service payments
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (c)  Benefits for incapacitated staff</p>

<p><strong>(1)  Defined contribution pension scheme</strong>
<br>The company operates a defined contribution pension scheme for all qualifying members of current staff in ROI and UK. The contributions are paid into a separate fund, the assets of which are invested by independent trustees. </p>

<p>The defined contribution pension scheme charge for 2014 was €0.7 million (2013: €0.7 million) all of which related to employees in Ireland and the UK. At December 31, 2014 an accrual of €0.09 million (2013: €0.09 million), in respect of pension costs is included in creditors, all of which relates to the parent company.</p>

<p><strong>(2)  Defined benefit pension arrangements</strong>

<p><strong>(a) Defined benefit pension scheme</strong></p>
<p>The company operates a defined benefit pension scheme, providing benefits based on final pensionable salary as at March 31, 2009. This scheme was closed to new members in 1993 and any existing staff who were still members moved to the defined contribution scheme in 2009. As a result of these changes no current or future benefits are being accrued under the defined benefit scheme. The scheme continues however to provide life assurance benefits to staff based on their annual salaries during their period of scheme membership. </p>

<p>The revised funding proposal provides for the company to make annual contributions of €0.2 million per annum in addition to maintaining its existing contribution rate of 25% of revalued pensionable salaries as at March 31, 2009 until October 31, 2018.<br /> </p>

<p>The most recent full valuation of the scheme was as at January 1, 2013 and was updated for FRS 17 Retirement Benefits purposes to December 31, 2014 by a qualified independent actuary. </p>
<p><strong><em>(i) Financial assumptions</em></strong></p>
<p>The principal financial assumptions used to calculate the retirement benefit liabilities were as follows:</p>

<p>Valuation method</p>
<p>Discount rate for scheme liabilities
Inflation rate
Rate of increase to pensions in payment
Salary increases</p>
<p>2014 
Projected unit method</p>
<p>2013 
Projected unit method</p>
<p>2.10%
1.50%
1.50%
N/A</p>
<p>3.80%
2.00%
1.75%
N/A</p>
<p>The mortality assumptions allow for future improvements in longevity, the valuation uses 108% of PNXL00 (U2013) mortality table 
for current employees and retired members. The assumptions are equivalent to expecting a 65 year old to live for a number of years 
as follows; current pensioner aged sixty five years and future retiree upon reaching sixty five years of age; male - 22.8 years (2013: 
22.7 years) and female - 24.1 years (2013: 24 years). The assumptions used by the actuary are chosen from a range of possible 
actuarial assumptions, which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice. </p>

<p>(a) Defined benefit pension scheme (continued) </p>
<p>If the life expectancy of a member had been changed to assume all members of the fund lived for one year longer, the value of the 
reported liabilities at December 31, 2014 would have increased by e0.4 million (2013: e0.3 million).</p>
<p>Assumptions relating to future salary increases are not applicable in 2014 as, with effect from March 31, 2009, there are no future 
benefits accruing.</p>
<p>(ii) Valuation
The scheme assets are stated at their bid value at each balance sheet date. The present value of the liability to meet future 
pension payments is arrived at by applying a discount rate equivalent to the rate of return expected to be derived from a Class 
AA corporate bond.</p>
<p>Using these bases, the valuation was as follows:</p>
<p>Long term rate of 
return expec ted at 
December 31,<br />
2014</p>
<p>Value at
December 31,

<p>In 2013, the group employed a building block approach in determining the rate of return on pension scheme assets. Historical 
markets were studied and assets with higher volatility were assumed to generate higher returns consistent with widely 
accepted capital market principles. The assumed rate of return on each asset class is set out above for the prior year. The 
overall expected rate of return on assets was then derived by aggregating the expected return for each asset class over the 
actual asset allocation for the scheme at the balance sheet date. Expected returns on assets are not disclosed for 2014 as this 
disclosure is not necessary given the transition to FRS 102 The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic 
of Ireland in 2015, as the return on assets is based on the discount rate.</p>

<p>The past service credit in 2014 of €0.078 million arises from the treatment of the pension levy (imposed by the Irish 
Government). The company declined to bear the cost of the pension levy and as a result the Trustees notified members that<br />
the cost of that levy at June 30, 2014 of €0.09 million (2013: €0.06 million) would have to be borne by the scheme members. </p>

<p>Using the same assumptions as have been used at December 31, 2014 the charge to the consolidated statement of financial 
activities for 2015 is expected to be €0.02 million. </p>
<p>(b)   Overseas local staf f service payments<br />
</p>
<p>In some of its overseas operations, the company has legal or constructive obligations to pay lump sum benefits to national 
staff on cessation of their employment. While the precise obligation varies from country to country it typically requires that the 
amount payable be based on terminal salary and length of service. </p>
<p>The schemes are not externally funded i.e. assets have not been placed in separately administered trusts to meet liabilities as 
they arise, instead the gross value of likely future payments is recognised as a liability at each balance sheet date. </p>
<p>As benefits payable under these schemes meet the definition of retirement benefits set out in FRS 17 Retirement Benefits, the 
company requested advice from independent professional actuaries, AON Hewitt, to review the methodology being utilised to 
determine liabilities in order to ensure that it would produce results in accordance with the standard. The actuarial assessment 
concluded that the methodology being used would produce calculations that materially meet the requirements of the standard, 
and in addition, it provided the information below in order to reflect the schemes in accordance with the requirements of FRS 
17 Retirement Benefits.</p>

<p>(b)   Overseas local staf f service payments (continued) </p>
<p>(i) Financial assumptions 
The main financial assumptions used to calculate the retirement benefit liabilities were as follows: </p>
<p>Rate of general long-term increase in salaries - US$ linked liabilities
Discount rate for liabilities - US$
Rate of general long-term increase in salaries - EUR€ linked liabilities
Discount rate for liabilities - EUR€
Rate of general long-term increase in salaries - Stg£ linked liabilities
Discount rate for liabilities - Stg£</p>
<p>(ii) Valuation 
Using these assumptions the unfunded liability was as follows: </p>
<p>Present value of scheme liabilities</p>
<p>Unfunded scheme liability</p>
<p>(iii) Movements in unfunded scheme liabilities</p>
<p>Scheme liability at beginning of year</p>
<p>Current service costs

Using the same assumptions as have been used at December 31, 2014 the charge to the consolidated statement of financial 
activities for 2015 in respect of overseas local staff payments is expected to be €1.9 million. </p>
<p>(c ) Liability for incapacitated staf f<br />
</p>
<p>The group pays ongoing benefits to two ex-staff members who became incapacitated while working overseas. The group believes 
that it has a moral and constructive obligation to continue to make these payments for as long as they are needed and as a result,<br />
</p>
<p>it has recognised a liability for these payments. </p>
<p>The group made investments to cover the liability to the incapacitated staff and these were transferred into a discretionary trust for 
the benefit of the relevant individuals in 2007. </p>
<p>As required by FRS 17 Retirement Benefits, an updated actuarial assessment of the liabilities to the incapacitated staff was carried 
out using the projected unit method at December 31, 2014 by AON Hewitt on behalf of the group. <br />
</p>
<p>(i) Financial assumptions
The main financial assumptions used to calculate the liability for incapacity benefits payable were as follows:</p>
<p>Rate of increase in benefits in payment 
Inflation rate
Discount rate for liabilities - EUR €
Discount rate for liabilities - Stg £</p>
<p>2014</p>
<p>2013</p>
<p>1.50%
1.50%
2 .10%
3 .35%</p>
<p>1.75%
2 .00%
3 .80%
4 .40%</p>
<p>In line with the changes made to the defined benefit pension scheme in 2012 the rate of increase in benefits has been 
changed from a fixed 3% p.a. to the lesser of CPI or 3% p.a. </p>
<p>In addition it has been assumed that the beneficiaries will enjoy a normal lifespan of eighty-nine years, they are currently aged </p>
<p>fifty and sixty-one years. </p>

<p>(c ) Liability for incapacitated staf f (continued)   </p>

<p>(ii) Valuation
The assets are stated at their bid value at each balance sheet date. The present value of the liability to meet future payments is 
arrived at by applying a discount rate equivalent to the rate of return expected to be derived from a Class AA corporate bond.</p>

<p>Using these bases the valuation was as follows:</p>

<p>In 2013, the group employed a building block approach in determining the rate of return on pension scheme assets. Historical 
markets were studied and assets with higher volatility were assumed to generate higher returns consistent with widely 
accepted capital market principles. The assumed rate of return on each asset class is set out above for the prior year. The 
overall expected rate of return on assets was then derived by aggregating the expected return for each asset class over the 
actual asset allocation for the scheme at the balance sheet date. Expected returns on assets are not disclosed for 2014 as this 
disclosure is not necessary given the transition to FRS 102 The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic 
of Ireland in 2015, as the return on assets is based on the discount rate.</p>

<p>(iii) Movement in fair value of scheme assets</p>

<p>Opening fair value of assets</p>

<p>Expected return on assets
Employer contributions
Benefits paid out
Actuarial gains/(losses) on assets</p>

<p>Closing fair value of assets</p>

<p>Actual return on scheme assets</p>

activities in 2015 in respect of the incapacitated staff arrangements is expected to be €0.006 million.</p>
