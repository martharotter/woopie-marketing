    <h1 style="font-size: 1.75em;line-height: 1.2;">TACKLING CHILD HUNGER</h1>
    <p> Good child nutrition is not just about families having enough food today. Babies and young children need a variety of nutritious food every day to grow and develop. We help prevent malnutrition by improving family food security, diets and health. We also provide specialist treatment for malnourished young children and pregnant women.</p>

<p>Unity state, South Sudan, faces crisis levels of food security. In June alone, 60 children died from malnutrition before their fifth birthday. As a result of our community- based prevention and treatment, only six young children died between August and December. As in many other countries, we integrate food security into our health programmes in South Sudan. At clinics, we screen all children for malnutrition – no matter why they are there.</p>

<p>Our nutrition programme in Zambia received an award from the Secure Nutrition Platform in 2014. We are reducing childhood malnutrition by increasing nutritious crops grown by families and by providing community- based dietary advice. We also train people to preserve food for times when fresh vegetables are not available. As a result, 78 per cent of children aged between six and 23 months are eating foods from at least four food groups – twice as many as in 2011.</p>

<p>We enable community groups to improve children’s nutrition, while strengthening local support services. In Uganda, we established 201 mothers’ groups, to share information and advice. We also managed malnutrition services in 31 health centres, treating 3,619 children. In the Republic of Sudan, we helped set up 60 mothers’ groups and 17 fathers’ groups, leading to better care for children.</p>

<p>As well as working on the ground, we influence national and international best practice in nutrition. In Burundi, we worked with the Ministry of Health on guidelines and strategies to reduce child malnutrition. We also participated in high-level events, including the Rome International Conference on Nutrition. </p>

<p>Increasing access to healthcare Access to healthcare is unequal. Extremely poor and remote communities often cannot get even basic healthcare. Concern saves lives by addressing this inequality.</p>

<p>For example, we support four health centres and 16 outreach sites in Chad. This has increased new medical consultations by one-third. We also helped the government’s polio vaccination campaign reach 16,362 settled and nomadic children, by providing transport to remote villages. </p>

<p>We support four of the five clinics in Jebel Moon, Republic of Sudan. We use donkeys and horses to transport medicine to the three most remote clinics so people have access to drugs. </p>

<p>In Uganda we reduced patient waiting times, increased access to healthcare at weekends and doubled attendance at antenatal clinics, giving mothers and babies the best start.</p>

<p><strong>Preventative healthcare</strong>
<br>Prevention is better than a cure. In Ethiopia, we taught 
40,000 families how to prevent infectious diseases. 
Through simple measures such as draining stagnant 
water, communities have reduced local cases of malaria 
from 8,577 in 2013 to 5,307 in 2014.</p>

<p>By working with the Ministry of Health in South Sudan 
since 2012, we have more than doubled the number 
of young children in Aweil West and North who are 
vaccinated against diphtheria and tetanus. </p>

<p>Our interventions target specific local needs. In Malawi, 
maternal mortality is high but few young people access 
reproductive healthcare. Young women who completed 
our Skillz Malawi course gained the confidence to 
negotiate safe sex and 95 per cent received voluntary 
H IV testing. We also extended our free health advice 
hotline to cover a whole district. </p>

<p>HIV and AIDS is no longer a standalone programme area 
for Concern – we now integrate it in almost all of our 
work. For example, in Liberia we included H IV awareness 
and prevention in our hygiene education and traditional 
midwife training across 25 communities. </p>

<p>The HIV and AIDS strand of our life skills project for 
garbage-picking children in Pakistan was selected for  
a poster presentation at the Melbourne International  
AIDS Conference.</p>

<p>In Bangladesh, we increased H IV awareness among 475 
community leaders and 19 community groups. The number 
of local survey respondents who can correctly identify ways 
of preventing H IV has more than doubled since 2013. </p>

<section class="content-block">
<p><strong>Water and sanitation</strong>
<br>Providing access to clean water, waste disposal and 
improving hygiene is an extremely effective way to 
prevent life-threatening diseases such as diarrhoea and 
cholera. Concern achieves this in many different ways 
around the world.</p>

<p>We have been improving water and sanitation systems 
in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea for 10 
years. In 2014, we installed nine solar powered water 
systems to overcome electrical supply problems. Since 
2013, diarrhoea has reduced by 16 per cent among a 
population of 15 villages.</p>

<p>In Lebanon, we used games and songs to teach children 
good handwashing practice. Our hygiene promotion 
messages reached around 313,000 people through  
SMS, social media, leaflets, posters, radio interviews  
and school visits. </p>

<p>Our approach in Somalia involved a comprehensive 
sanitation survey and water safety plan. We trained all our 
local partners in water testing and treatment, and provided 
water testing kits. This has reduced waterborne diseases.</p>

<section class="content-block">
<p>In Syria and Turkey we provided clean water sources for 
255,500 people affected by the Syria crisis by treating 
water and installing generators. We also distributed 
3,950 hygiene kits containing items including soap, 
toothbrushes and nappies.</p>

<p>Some 231,061 people in flood-prone areas benefited 
from clean-up campaigns run by Concern and our 
partners in South Kordofan, Republic of Sudan.  
We disposed of solid waste and drained stagnant  
water in 65 towns and villages.</p>

<p>Most of our water and sanitation projects include training 
community groups to manage their water and sewerage 
systems independently. In Tanzania, we established 
133 water user groups. In Uganda, we trained 46 
water committees on system maintenance, financial 
management and gender equality.</p>

<p><strong>Strengthening healthcare systems</strong>
<br>Some of the world’s poorest countries have broken 
or insufficient health systems. We work with partners, 
governments and local authorities to build up these 
infrastructures, to benefit generations to come.</p>

<p>We have been strengthening healthcare systems in Niger 
since 2009. In 2014, we continued to support 77 health 
centres and health posts through training and equipment. 
We increased the number of community-based healthcare 
providers from 21 to 57 before handing over healthcare 
management to local authorities. The final programme 
evaluation noted across-the-board improvements in 
healthcare access and quality as a result of our work. 
Now, four times as many local parents seek healthcare  
for childhood illness within 24 hours.</p>

<p>Across four districts of Rwanda, we conducted 16 feedback 
sessions with staff in four health facilities. As a result,  
staff have committed to respect national protocols on  
acute malnutrition.</p>

<p>In Kenya, Concern is a member of more than 10 health 
working groups and coordinating committees. We 
provided technical support in national and local health 
surveys and convinced local government to fund 10 
health workers previously supported by us. </p>

<p><strong>Innovations for Maternal, Newborn and Child Health </strong>
<br>Innovations for Maternal, Newborn &amp; Child Health 
(Innovations), is a project managed by Concern 
Worldwide (US) Inc. (see note 26 page 104). It is funded 
by a multi-year grant from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates 
Foundation. The aim is to accelerate the discovery and 
testing of creative solutions to overcome barriers that 
prevent essential health services from reaching women 
and children. </p>

<p>Innovations implemented two pilots in Kenya, with Maker 
Hub we have forged a ground-breaking partnership 
between clinicians at Kenyatta National Hospital and 
the engineering department at the University of Nairobi. 
The pilot serves as a model for designing cost-effective 
equipment that meets local needs and can eventually be 
manufactured in-country to improve care while creating 
jobs and spurring growth. </p>

<p>The Mobile Urgent Maternity Service (MUM) aims 
to bring emergency services closer to rural women and 
their newborns. MUM makes it possible to determine 
where best to place health facilities, mobile clinics and 
ambulances to ensure that emergency care can reach the 
maximum number of women quickly and cost-effectively. </p>

<p>In Sierra Leone, our Essential Newborn Care Corps 
educates, equips, and empowers non-literate traditional 
birth attendants. Through specially adapted training, the 
women become Maternal Newborn Health Promoters 
who serve as advocates for counseling expectant  
mothers referring them to skilled health facilities for  
safer deliveries.</p>
