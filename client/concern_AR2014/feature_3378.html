<p><strong>Food security</strong>
<br>
Concern believes that food is the first step to progress. 
We help vulnerable households ensure they can grow or 
buy sufficient food, now and in the future.</p>

<p><strong>Mozambique’s</strong> small-scale farmers have been badly affected by droughts and poor harvests. Working with public and private sector partners, we are improving farming methods and nutritional knowledge. Our farmer field schools benefited 3,978 farmers, helping them overcome some of the challenges of erratic rains. By linking 100 mothers’ groups to the farmer field schools, we have increased the availability and understanding of nutritious food. This has more than doubled the number of women and young children who eat four or more food groups.</p>
<p>Our farmer field schools also benefited 15,022 people in rural <strong>Rwanda</strong>. Now, better farming techniques mean that households produce more food. They are also saving money and lending to their neighbours, building resilience for the future. We trained 183 local government staff in nutrition and agricultural management to sustain these benefits. </p>

<p>People in the <strong>Democratic People’s Republic of Korea</strong> face chronic food insecurity. We are making collective farms and household plots more productive in various ways. We improve water management, and extend growing seasons by supplying greenhouses. In 2014 we established four urban and three rural food processing facilities, such as oil presses and flour mills, to increase the value of crops and save farmers time. </p>
</section>
<section class="content-block ">
<p><strong>Protecting assets</strong>
<br>A key aspect of our livelihoods work is ensuring that poor families have the right tools to support themselves. We help families to protect their sources of income and avoid having to sell them.</p>

<p>In <strong>Tanzania</strong>, we are helping 2,671 impoverished people secure land rights so they can support themselves. This involves establishing seven village land registries to manage land rights in the long term. In many communities, women have less money and independence than men, making them more vulnerable to poverty. Since 2013, our work in 40 Tanzanian villages has given women 54 per cent more control of six key household assets, including land, livestock and money.</p>

<p>We started a three-year project with the University of Greenwich, UK to reduce rodent damage to crops. In <strong>Sierra Leone</strong>, we worked in six farming communities to train farmers and supply rat traps. As a result, farmers caught 4,630 rats and lost one-sixth of the crops they usually would. We brought together 36 representatives from local and national governments, NGOs and research institutions to learn from the project. </p>

<p>In <strong>Burundi</strong>, Concern was invited to join the Social Protection National Technical Working Group, based on our success in tackling poverty. This is a significant achievement as the group is usually restricted to UN agencies and donors. We helped influence national strategy and ways of reaching the very poorest people. </p>

<p>We also trained Social Protection Commission staff on using cash transfers to reduce poverty.</p>

<p>Protecting assets is a core part of many Concern emergency programmes as well as our development work. In the Philippines we provided boats, fishing gear and repair kits or grants to 11,004 families affected by Typhoon Haiyan. This helped 90 per cent of these households return to fishing. </p>

<p>In Central African Republic, we are assisting 34,200 people displaced by conflict by distributing seeds and tools. We employed some of the poorest adults to repair roads and drains, benefiting the whole community while they earned a living.</p>

<p>Following one of the worst harvests this century, we distributed almost 157 metric tonnes of millet, sorghum and peanut seeds to 3,485 farming families in Chad. Our evaluation found that 98 per cent of beneficiaries planted the seeds instead of eating them, increasing their future food security. </p>

<section class="content-block ">
<p><strong>Increasing and diversifying incomes</strong>
<br>Building short and long-term resilience is vital. That is why we support families to increase their incomes or generate additional sources of income.</p>

<p>In Haiti, we assisted 1,461 small avocado and mango 
producers. Working with growers’ associations, we trained 
farmers and established nurseries to help increase 
harvests. We built two processing centres to add value 
to the fruit crops, and 13km of road to increase access 
to markets. Over four years, the amount of avocados and 
mangos sold at market increased 24-fold. </p>

<p>Across eight districts of Pakistan, we benefited 96,550 extremely poor people by diversifying and increasing family livelihoods. In 2014, local crop production increased by more than 30 per cent. We increased household income by the same amount, through work skills and small business training. </p>

<p>In Bangladesh we tackled extreme poverty among Char (river island) communities, who are particularly vulnerable to climate change. By helping to secure access to land, seeds and livestock vaccinations, we increased by 20 per cent, the number who earned enough to support their basic needs. </p>

<p>Our livelihoods and women’s empowerment programme in Zambia means that 8,089 households have more diverse incomes – most no longer rely on piecework. Through radio discussions and community drama, we have changed perceptions about the role of women, enabling them to participate in community groups. The programme has also increased access to H IV and AIDS information and testing via mobile services. </p>

<p>The Government of Ethiopia was so impressed by two of our projects that it has replicated them on a larger scale. One project engaged landless youth groups in rehabilitating degraded land so they can earn a secure income. The other enabled women’s saving and credit cooperatives to support livestock rearing, marketing produce and other small enterprises. Increasing assets and incomes in these ways has reduced local migration. </p>

<section class="content-block ">
<p><strong>Supporting sustainable livelihoods</strong>
<br>We support communities to manage natural resources 
and adopt climate-smart agricultural practices to ensure 
livelihoods last.</p>

<p>In Chad, we trained farmers in 35 villages how to reduce 
soil degradation to improve their yields, without resorting 
to chemicals. Some 88 per cent of them now use crop 
rotation to increase soil fertility and potential income.</p>

<p>In Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, we taught 
farmers how to prevent soil erosion. During a severe 
drought, farmers in Concern areas fared better than 
others. Another 400 households adopted these techniques 
themselves, increasing their harvest and reducing fungal 
crop disease. To share best practice, we organised a 
national conference on conservation agriculture.</p>

<p>We promoted sustainable tourism in Haiti. By training 
214 people and building guesthouses, we increased 
tourist accommodation by 20 per cent and provided 400 
short-term jobs. Two craft shops and a hotel have since 
opened locally, which is a promising sign. We also supported 
sustainable fishing in 15 villages, distributing boats and 
equipment, and training 12 technicians in boat maintenance.</p>

<p>Around 150,000 people in the Philippines benefited from our work with the government on preserving fish stocks and other natural resources that support local businesses. We planted 48,686 mangrove seedlings and 5,245 coral fragments to support fish habitats.</p>

<p>In the Republic of Sudan, we established five village development associations in Mornei, in addition to four in 2013. These groups oversee 18 community projects, including food processing and youth training, benefiting 34,900 people. The groups generate profits to support the community, for example by paying for orphans’ school fees, teachers’ salaries or repairs to health centres. </p>
