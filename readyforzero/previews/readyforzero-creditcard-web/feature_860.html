        <p>Whew, we’ve gone over quite a bit of information to help you optimize your credit card situation and pay that debt off faster! Now, let’s get to the fun part - talking about life after credit card debt.</p>
<h1>How to Give Yourself a Raise By Paying Off Debt</h1>
<p>Now that we’ve highlighted what debt is, let’s address the benefits of paying it off faster. Consider this: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Money is like water in a bucket. Each debt you have is a hole in the bucket. Therefore, every month you have debt, you leak your money out of the bucket. But when you pay off your debt you’re plugging the holes in your bucket - no more spilling your hard-earned money. Imagine what you could do with that extra income! <a href="http://www.carefulcents.com/">Carrie Smith</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>How Paying Off Debt Is Like Getting a Raise</strong> <br/> Once you no longer need to plug the holes of debt, you’ll not only spend less in the future, but you’ll have more money right away. Here’s how:</p>
<p><strong><em>Paying Off Debt Stops Interest Fees and Charges</em></strong> <br/> When you decide to finally get out of debt, you’ll no longer be at the mercy of lenders. Paying off debt stops the interest charges, late fees, and annual credit card fees which constantly <a href="https://www.readyforzero.com/cost-of-credit-card-debt/?c=ebook/creditcarddebt">drain your monthly income</a>.</p>
<p>Remember, your income is your most powerful wealth building tool. Not throwing it away on fees and interest gives you an instant raise. Then you can use that newfound money to save, invest, or do whatever you <strong><em>choose</em></strong>.</p>
<p><strong><em>Paying Off Debt Frees Up Your Future Income</em></strong> <br/> None of us truly know what our income will be in the future. If the 2008 recession taught us anything, it’s that no one can count on their place in the economy. Using credit cards or loans to make purchases with the plan to pay them off in the future is simply too risky.</p>
<p><em>What if you lose your job? What if you get seriously injured?</em></p>
<p>Your future income and stability need to be top priority right now, not later. Paying off debt (or avoiding accumulating debt) will help you protect that future. In order to prevent the need to take on new debt in an emergency, you should not only pay your debt off, but save money each month towards an emergency fund. These tactics will help keep your finances in check and your future on the right path - no matter when or if an economic downturn hits.</p>
<p><strong><em>Paying Off Debt Allows You to Save and Invest</em></strong> <br/> Some of the best ways to “spend” your money is to put cash into an emergency fund and to invest in a retirement account. But if you’re making monthly payments on debt, you may not have any funds left over to apply to these goals each month.</p>
<p>However, once your debt is paid off, you can funnel the funds that were going to monthly payments into monthly savings. <em>Then you can earn interest on your money rather than pay it.</em> In other words, your money will start <em>working for you</em> and not the other way around!</p>
<p><strong>Spend Money On What Matters</strong> <br/> When you <a href="http://blog.readyforzero.com/how-to-achieve-your-financial-goals/?c=ebook/creditcarddebt">prioritize what to spend your money on</a>, you’re able to determine what’s worth paying for and what you can live without. For example: a cell phone with a good internet plan may be more important to you than paying for cable.</p>
<p>However, it’s easy to get into a habit of mindlessly paying for things we don’t really care about. But once you pay your debt off, you can finally start putting more money into your pocket and focus on your future. You know, the stuff that really matters.</p>

<p><strong>Calculate Your Debt Payoff Raise</strong> <br/> To see how much of a raise you could be getting once your debt is paid off, add up the payments you’re making on your debt accounts each month. That amount is how much money you’d have to do whatever you want with once those accounts are paid off.</p>
<p>How’s that for motivation to kick your debt repayment into high gear?</p>
<h1>Living Life without Credit Card Debt</h1>
<p><figure class="media-element-side"><img src="articleContent/860/dandelion_in_the_wind.jpg" width="100%" alt="" /><figcaption><p>Image Credit: <a href="http://bit.ly/1iCMuhO">nerdegutt</a></p></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Living without the burden of debt is liberating, but old habits die hard. You might have fought hard to get out of debt but if you return to your old habits you may once again find yourself living in financial bondage. Let’s take a look at how that process will begin and how you can avoid going back into debt.</p>
<p>About the time you get your debt down to a point where it’s manageable, you begin receiving offers for credit cards. Debt is a product. It is marketed as such and is consumed as such. Lenders will stop at nothing at trying to find new consumers for their product.</p>
<p>Credit card companies often target consumers who are coming out of a situation just like yours. <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-to-stop-credit-offers/">According to the FTC</a>, many companies solicit new credit card customers based on the information in your credit report.</p>
<p><strong>Should You Restore Your Credit?</strong> <br/> That’s a question that can only be answered by you. But there are plenty of people willing to offer an opinion. Some well-known experts will tell you that you don’t need a good credit score – or any credit score at all. Others will tell you to use credit responsibly and in moderation.</p>
<p>If you’re honest with yourself you should be able to come up with your own answer. For most people, it makes sense to at least keep an eye on your credit score so you're prepared for any situations that might come up which require having a good credit score. Remember to keep checking your score regularly at <a href="https://www.annualcreditreport.com/index.action">annualcreditreport.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Why Restore Your Credit Score?</strong> <br/> One of the main reasons people decide to rebuild their credit is to buy a home. Despite the events of the last few years, owning a home is still a significant component of the American dream for many.</p>
<p>While some may be able to pay cash for a car, home furnishings, and other big ticket items, paying cash for a home is quite a bit harder. Manual underwriting mortgage companies can help.</p>
<p>Manual underwriting is when a real person looks at your financial information and makes an assessment of how you pay your bills to decide if you qualify for a mortgage. This differs from credit scores computed by sophisticated algorithms to make that decision. However, what if you’d rather try the conventional means to securing a mortgage? Do you need a wallet full of credit cards to restore your credit?</p>
<p><strong>How To Rebuild Credit</strong> 
<figure class="media-element-side"><img src="articleContent/860/walkway.jpg" width="100%" alt="" /><figcaption><p>Image Credit: <a href="http://bit.ly/1iCNhPO">anttler</a></p></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>If you decide to rebuild your credit, remember that credit was why you were once in debt. This time, build in safeguards to protect yourself from the bondage of debt the second time. Here are a few things to consider if you are looking for alternatives to credit cards that may help you build credit.</p>
<p><strong>Savings Account Loans:</strong> <br/> Savings account and CD loans might be a good place to start. These types of loans are most common at smaller financial institutions, but each work nearly identically. You borrow money using your savings accounts or CDs as collateral. Interest rates are generally low because you’re assuming all of the risk by using your own money. These loans are a great option for consumers looking to repair their credit. Borrowing against your CD rather than cashing it in prematurely eliminates early withdrawal penalties—another advantage of these types of loans.</p>
<p>In order for savings account and CD loans to help rebuild your credit score, they have to report to each of the credit bureaus. Before agreeing to one of these loans, confirm that the bank will report your positive credit activity.</p>
<p><strong>Secured Cards:</strong> <br/> Secured credit cards are another option to restore and rebuild your credit score and function just like a savings account loan. With secured cards, the funds on deposit at your bank become your spending limit on the card (minus fees).</p>
<p>You will never be able to spend more than your account balance, but if you don’t pay your bill in full each month, fees and interest may apply. Charge cards require that you pay your balance in full each month as well and you earn rewards for using the card. The major difference between the two types of cards is the cap on the spending limit.</p>
<p><strong>Bottom Line</strong> <br/> Credit cards are not appropriate for everyone. Make only the decisions that are right for you. Advertisers spend a lot of money to tell you why buying their product will make your life better. But remember, living debt-free feels way better than spending money on things you don’t need with money you don’t have.</p>
