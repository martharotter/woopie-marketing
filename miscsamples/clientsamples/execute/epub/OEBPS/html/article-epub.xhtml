				<p>We’ve all felt inspired at some point in our lives. I could go into a psychological analysis or what happens chemically inside of your brain when you’re inspired, but I don’t think that’s necessary here. Not to mention we don’t have the time if we want to execute quickly.</p>
				<p>I like to think of inspiration as the adult version of a kid at Christmas time (apply your own gift-driven holiday there). You’re extremely excited to see what’s inside those boxes. You’re ready to go exploring and your imagination is running wild with ideas.</p>
				<p>But just like at Christmas, if you don’t act on that excitement and start to open the boxes, you won’t be able to find what you’re looking for. You won’t be able to explore all of the opportunities and you won’t find great things because you’re not actively looking.</p>
				<p>Can you remember what it was like on the morning of Christmas? You were so jazzed about the possibilities that nothing could have distracted you. You had a one-track mind and tunnel vision. You had a goal and you were so excited that nothing could deter you from that goal. That’s the power of inspiration. It can get you so excited and focused that you never get distracted from your goal of execution. Everything that you learned about inspiration as a child can now be channeled into an energy that helps you become someone that can execute.</p>
				<h2>The Power of Inspiration</h2>
				<p>Inspiration is a powerful force. It can cause people to find religion and change the entire course of their lives. Some have even claimed that the power of inspiration can heal people, and cause them to do things that would have never been physically possible before.</p>
				<p>People spend millions of dollars a year to go to seminars and conferences from people like Tony Robbins, not for the knowledge that they’ll gain (they’ll most likely never use it anyway), but for the inspiration to start making a change.</p>
				<p>Inspiration can make us a write a new song, compose a new line of prose, learn a new instrument, fall in love, change the world, or write a book. It’s a powerful force that can shove us into purposeful action.</p>
				<h2>Where Does Inspiration Come From?</h2>
				<p>Inspiration can come from a myriad of places: conversations with friends, over hearing stories, reading a book, checking out your friend’s dribbble shots, or your Twitter feed. Some people find inspiration from stealing (put not claiming as their own) art, photography, music, code, or designs. They find that emulating super-talented people gets them jazzed to do their own work.</p>
				<p>Where you get inspiration from doesn’t matter, but making sure you get it does.</p>
				<p>The key is you have to be open to inspiration. There are a multitude of things begging for our attention these days, but inspiration can’t be received by the over-worked and busy mind.</p>
				<p>Burnout is the enemy of inspiration.</p>
				<p>Make sure that you live life at a good pace, with space in the middle, so you have the freedom to put yourself in places that will subject you to inspiration.</p>
				<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
				<p>Inspiration is the single most powerful form of energy that a creative professional has outside of adrenalin for survival. (But we have self- imposed time constraints on our side to help that kick in too.)</p>
				<p>Inspiration is precious.</p>
				<p>It’s the creative lifeline. Without it, our lives and body of work will suffer indefinitely. Ever heard of writer’s block? If we have builder’s block we’ll never have anything to build and we’ll be stuck exactly where we are today... forever. Tragic.</p>
				<p>But we’re not going to let that happen. We’re going to be open and ready to be inspired. We’re going to surround ourselves with art, people, books, films and the music we need to produce inspiration. We’re are going to be inspired. It’s only a matter of when. When it does happen, we’ll be ready, and we’ll turn that inspiration into energy for doing great work.</p>
