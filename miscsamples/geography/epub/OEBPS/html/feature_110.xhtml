<h3>Geographic Thinking <b>(A)</b></h3>
<h4>Making Comparisons</h4>
<p>Why might geographers be more interested in the climate of a place than its weather?</p>
</aside>

<p>Weather and climate are often confused. <b class="tooltip" title="n. the condition of the atmosphere at a particular location and time.">Weather</b> is the condition of the atmosphere at a particular location and time. <b class="tooltip" title="n. the typical weather conditions at a particular location as observed over time.">Climate</b> is the term for weather conditions at a particular location over a long period of time. Northern Russia, for example, has a cold climate. (A)</p>
<h3>What causes the weather?</h3>
<p>Daily weather is the complex result of several conditions. For example, the amount of solar energy received by a location varies according to the earth’s position in relation to the sun. Large masses of air absorb and distribute this solar energy, which in turn affects the weather. Other factors include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>water vapor</strong> This determines whether there will be <b class="tooltip" title="n. falling water droplets in the form of rain, sleet, snow, or hail.">precipitation</b>— falling water droplets in the form of rain, sleet, snow, or hail.</li>
<li><strong>cloud cover</strong> Clouds may hold water vapor.</li>
<li><strong>landforms and bodies of water</strong> Water heats slowly but also loses heat slowly. Land heats rapidly but loses heat quickly as well.</li>
<li><strong>elevation</strong> As elevation above sea level increases, the air becomes thinner and loses its ability to hold moisture.</li>
<li><strong>air movement</strong> Winds move the air and the solar energy and moisture that it holds. As a result, weather can change very rapidly.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Precipitation</h3>
<p>Precipitation depends on the amount of water vapor in the air and the movement of that air. As warm air rises, it cools and loses its ability to hold water vapor. The water vapor condenses, and the water droplets form into clouds. When the amount of water in a cloud is too heavy for the air to hold, rain or snow falls from the cloud. Geographers classify precipitation as convectional, orographic, or frontal, as illustrated in the diagram on this page. </p>

<h3>Types of Precipitation</h3>
<ol>
<li><b>Convectional</b> Typical of hot climates, convection occurs after morning sunshine heats warm moist air. Clouds form in the afternoon and rain falls.</li>
<li><b>Orographic</b> Associated with mountain areas, orographic storms drop more rain on the windwar side of a mountain and create a rain shadow on the leeward side.</li>
<li><b>Frontal</b> Mid-latitude storms feature cold dense air masses that push lighter warm air masses upward, causing precipitation to form.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>Convectional precipitation occurs in hot, moist climates where the sun quickly heats the air. The heated air rises, and by afternoon clouds form and rain falls. Orographic precipitation falls on the windward side of hills or mountains that block moist air and force it upward. The air cools and rain or snow falls.</p>
<p>The land on the leeward side is called a <b class="tooltip" title="n. the land on the leeward side of hills or mountains that gets little rain from the descending dry air.">rain shadow</b> because it gets little rain from the descending dry air. Frontal movement causes most precipitation in the middle latitudes. A front is the boundary between two air masses of different temperatures or density. Rain or snow occurs when lighter, warm air is pushed upward by the colder, denser air. The rising air cools, water vapor condenses, and precipitation falls.</p>
