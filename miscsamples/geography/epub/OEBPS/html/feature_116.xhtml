				<p>As air masses warm and cool and move across the earth’s surface, they create weather. Sometimes the clashes between air masses cause storms, which can be severe. They disrupt the usual patterns of life and often cause major property damage and loss of human life. Hurricanes, tornadoes, blizzards, droughts, and floods are examples of extreme weather.</p>
<h2>Hurricanes</h2>

<p>Storms that form over warm, tropical ocean waters are called <b class="tooltip" title="n. a storm that forms over warm, tropical ocean waters.">hurricanes</b>—also known as <b class="tooltip" title="n. a tropical storm, like a hurricane, that occurs in the western Pacific.">typhoons</b> in Asia. These storms are called different names around the globe: tropical cyclones, willy-willies (Australia), baguios (Philippines), and chubascos (Mexico). </p>
<p>Hurricanes are one way heat from the tropics is moved out of the region. Air flowing over an ocean with a water temperature of 80°F or higher picks up huge amounts of moisture and heat energy. As these water-laden winds flow into a low-pressure core, they tighten to form an “eye.” The eye is usually 10 to 20 miles across and has clear, calm skies. But the winds moving around the eye may be as strong as 200 miles per hour.</p>

</aside>

<p>The clouds and winds stretch over a vast area, sometimes as wide as 500 miles. Upper air currents blowing from the east steer the hurricanes in a westerly direction. As the hurricane hits land, it pounds the area with howling winds and very heavy rains. It may also cause a storm surge along coastal regions. This wall of seawater, pushed ashore by the winds, may rise to 16 feet or more. The low-lying coastal regions of  Bangladesh in South Asia are especially vulnerable to storm surges from tropical cyclones. (B)</p>
<h2>Tornados</h2>

<p>Unlike hurricanes, which take days to develop, tornadoes form quickly and sometimes without warning. A <b class="tooltip" title="n. a powerful funnel-shaped column of spiraling air.">tornado</b>, or twister, is a powerful funnel-shaped column of spiraling air.</p>

<h1>5 Themes - Region</h1>
<h2>Tornado Alley</h2>
<img src="https://beta.woop.ie/media/articleContent/116/tornado-alley.jpg" class="medium go-right" />
<p>When cold, dry air collides with warm, moist air, a tornado can brew. In the United States, these violent funnel clouds occur frequently between May and October in a region known as “Tornado Alley.”</p>
<p>The flat plains stretching from Texas through Nebraska present an ideal staging ground for tornadoes. Cold, dry air from Canada rushes south and collides with warm, moist air moving north from the Gulf of Mexico. Between 200 and 300 major storms erupt there each year, spawning hundreds of tornadoes.</p>
</div>

<p>Born from strong thunderstorms, tornadoes are capable of immense damage. In a tornado, winds swirl counter-clockwise around a low-pressure center. These winds may reach speeds of 300 miles per hour, blasting apart buildings and lifting objects as large as cars and mobile homes. Generally, tornadoes have small diameters (about 300 feet), travel about a mile, and last only a few minutes. However, the largest and most forceful can reach a mile across and stay on the ground for hours, hopscotching from one location to another.</p>

<h3>Geographic Thinking <b>(C)</b></h3>
<h4>Making Comparisons</h4>
<p>How are tornados different from hurricanes?</p>
</aside>

<p>The largest outbreak of tornadoes in the United States occurred during a 16-hour period, April 3 and 4, 1974. A total of 148 tornadoes ripped through the Ohio and Tennessee valleys, killing 330 people. The largest share of tornadoes, about 3 of every 4, hit in the United States. On average, the U.S. National Weather Service counts 700 tornadoes each year. (C) </p>
<h2>Blizzards</h2>
<p>A <b class="tooltip" title="n. a heavy snowstorm with winds of more than 35 miles per hour and reduced visibility of less than one-quarter mile.">blizzard</b> is a heavy snowstorm with winds of more than 35 miles per hour and reduced visibility. These weather conditions snarl traffic, endanger livestock, and trap travelers. The greatest snowfall for a 24-hour period was 76 inches (6 feet 4 inches) in Silver Lake, Colorado, in 1921. A snowstorm that lasted from February 13 to 19, 1959, dumped 189 inches (almost 16 feet) of snow on Mt. Shasta, California.</p>
<p>Because of their location, some areas of the country are frequently hit with snowstorms that produce huge amounts of snow. For example, the eastern and southern shores of the Great Lakes are snowbelts that experience days and days of heavy snow resulting in enormous snow depths. Around the Lake Erie and Lake Ontario areas, the annual snowfall can be as much as 450 inches (37.5 feet).</p>
<h2>Droughts</h2>
<aside class="sidebar go-right">
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>A series of droughts in Texas between 1996 and 2000 caused $5.3 billion in damages.</p>
</aside>

<p>A <b class="tooltip" title="n. a long period without rain or with very minimal rainfall.">drought</b> is a long period of time without rain or with very minimal rainfall. This lack of rain results in crop failures and drastically reduced levels in water storage facilities. In the early 1930s, a drought hit the Great Plains in the United States. Dust storms damaged farms across a 150,000 square-mile region that became known as the “Dust Bowl.”</p>
<figure class="media-element-side"><img src="../articleContent/116/region.jpg" alt="A boat on dry land" /><figcaption>Region - Before the drought in Texas, this boat floated on the waters of a lake now barely visible in the background. How is life affected by drought?</figcaption></figure>
<p>Suffering the effects of a harsh climate, thousands of families were forced to leave their land to find work elsewhere. (See the Dust Bowl Disaster feature on pages 150-151.) In 2000, a large portion of the southern United States was struck with a long drought. Northern Texas was particularly hard hit, with 84 straight days of no rain and extremely high temperatures.</p>
<h2>Floods</h2>
<p>When water spreads over land not normally covered with water, it is called a flood. Melting snow or rainwater fills streams or rivers until they reach flood stage, the point at which the banks can no longer contain the water. The water then flows into the surrounding area, called a floodplain.</p>
<p>Floods take lives every year, especially in low, flat places like Bangladesh, where millions of people live on the flood plains and the delta. In 1993, flooding along the Mississippi and Missouri rivers claimed 50 lives and caused about $15 billion in damage. Nearly 150 rivers and their tributaries were involved. It was the largest flood ever to hit the United States.</p>
<p>In the next section, you will learn about how climate affects people’s lives and how humans adapt to changes in climate. </p>
