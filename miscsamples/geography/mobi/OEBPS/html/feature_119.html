            <h1>Defining the Skill</h1>
<p>A <strong>cause</strong> is why something happens. An <strong>effect</strong> is what happens. A single cause can lead to one or multiple effects. One effect can have multiple causes. Cause-effect chains are also common, in which a cause leads to an effect that becomes the cause of another effect, and so on.</p>
<h1>Applying the Skill</h1>
<p>The following paragraphs sum up major events in the recent European past. Use the listed strategies to analyze the cause-effect relationships. </p>
<h2>How to Determine Cause and Effect</h2>
<h3>Strategy</h3>
<ol class="number-highlight-list">
<li>Use the word *why* to formulate questions about the topic of the passage. Example: *Why was there conflict in Europe?* The answers you find will be the causes.</li>
<li>Look for words such as  *because, cause, in order to,* and *reason,* which signal causes. Look for words such as *so, consequence,* and *results,* which signal effects.</li>
<li>Restate the cause-effect connections in your own words or in a diagram.</li>
</ol>

<h3><span class="number-highlight"><b>1</b></span> Conflict in Europe</h3>

<p>Western Europe experienced industrial growth in the 1800s. <span class="number-highlight"><b>2</b> Industrialism caused European nations to set up colonies in other lands in order to gain raw materials and markets.</span> Many European nations saw each other as rivals in the race to gain colonies. <span class="number-highlight"><b>2</b> The nationalistic rivalry and competition for colonies among European nations helped cause World War I.</span> The Allied Powers (including France) fought the Central Powers (Germany, Austria-Hungary, and their allies). The Allies won and imposed harsh terms on Germany. <span class="number-highlight"><b>2</b> German resentment over those terms helped cause World War II, in which Germany, led by Adolf Hitler and the Nazis, tried to conquer Europe.</span></p>
<h2>Make a Diagram</h2>
<p>A diagram can show how causes and effects are connected. Because the example passage tells how one event led to another, a cause-effect chain is a useful way to diagram its major ideas.</p>
