			<h2>Main Ideas</h2>
<p>Seasons and weather occur because of the changing position of the earth in relation to the sun.</p>
<p>Weather extremes are related to location on earth.</p>
<h2>Places and Terms</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>solstice</strong> - either of two times of year when the sun’s rays shine directly overhead at noon at the furthest points north or south, and that mark the beginning of summer and winter; in the Northern Hemisphere, the summer solstice is the longest day and the winter solstice the shortest.</li>
<li><strong>equinox</strong> - each of the two days in a year on which day and night are equal in length; marks the beginning of spring and autumn.</li>
<li><strong>weather</strong> - the condition of the atmosphere at a particular location and time.</li>
<li><strong>climate</strong> - the typical weather conditions at a particular location as observed over time.</li>
<li><strong>precipitation</strong> - falling water droplets in the form of rain, sleet, snow, or hail.</li>
<li><strong>rain shadow</strong> - the land on the leeward side of hills or mountains that gets little rain from the descending dry air.</li>
<li><strong>hurricane</strong> - a storm that forms over warm, tropical ocean waters.</li>
<li><strong>typhoon</strong> - a tropical storm, like a hurricane, that occurs in the western Pacific.</li>
<li><strong>tornado</strong> - a powerful funnel-shaped column of spiraling air.</li>
<li><strong>blizzard</strong> - a heavy snowstorm with winds of more than 35 miles per hour and reduced visibility of less than one-quarter mile.</li>
<li><strong>drought</strong> - a long period without rain or with very minimal rainfall.</li>
</ul>

<h2>A Human Perspective</h2>
<p>The smell of thousands of decaying corpses hung in the air in what was once the thriving seaport of Galveston, Texas. The day before, winds estimated at 130 miles per hour roared through the city. A storm surge of seawater more than 15 feet high pushed a wall of debris across the island of Galveston. Through this turmoil, Isaac Cline’s family huddled in their home.</p>
<p>A trolley trestle rammed the house until at last it collapsed, and the waves poured in. Cline survived, but some of his family did not. With a death toll of up to 12,000 human lives, the hurricane that hit Galveston Island on September 8, 1900, remains the deadliest natural disaster in United States history.</p>
