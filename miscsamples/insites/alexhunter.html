		<p class="question">You’ve long had a fascination with the intersection of technology, business, and customer service. How did it all start?</p>
		<p class="answer">I was always into computers for as long as I could remember. I had a Commodore 64 in my room from the time I was six. My father used to leave these management books lying around by Tom Peters. From twelve years old, I would just devour them. I became obsessed with business. I wanted to start and run my own business, but I wanted to do it for all the wrong reasons: I wanted a business card.</p>
        <p>As the internet came along, I realised that my obsession with business, customer service, and storytelling all met in this beautiful medium called ‘the web’. It could be used as a branding tool and to tell stories, and you could appear much bigger than you actually were. On our gap year, one of my best friends and I started creating websites to teach ourselves and create these stories.</p>
		<p class="question">What year was this?</p>
		<p class="answer">1997 or 1998. I went back to California for most of my gap year and we started a web company, the mission of which was to take over the world. What we actually did was build websites for small businesses.</p>

        <p>We had epic business cards. We spent a lot of money and made very little, but it was an education. My first ‘proper’ job during my gap year was in Hong Kong with the airline Cathay Pacific. I worked as a sub-editor for their newspaper, but always tried to find ways to hang out with the web guys.</p>
        <p>The massive, beautiful, serendipitous coincidence was that the guy in Hong Kong who ran the web department team was from the town over from me in California. We immediately had this connection and he’s remained a mentor to this day. I went back to work for them a number of times on their web projects and that’s where I cut my teeth on HTML, CSS, and Javascript. When you’re putting out a product that potentially millions of people are going to use, it kind of has to work.</p>
		<p class="question">What happened after Cathay Pacific?</p>
		<p class="answer">I got into the University of Kent, and I loved it, but then I got a job offer in California from what is now AT&T, to be an Associate Director of e-business. I was only nineteen years old. They’re like, ‘<q>we’ll pay you $80,000.</q>’ I landed on my feet and I got this job, and again, you go from this hugely bright-eyed, bushy-tailed purist view of, ‘<q>this is the web and it’s going to change the world and amazing things happen in California,</q>’ to ‘<q>I work for the second-largest employer in the US.</q>’ It was such an amazing education. You go in at nineteen and you’re brash and opinionated and you assume you know everything and, of course, you make mistakes.</p>
        <p>I stayed there a year and learned a lot. Then I went to one of the biggest staffing companies in the world that had an IT department of 150 people. I was hired as a business systems analyst — which is as awful as it sounds — but it gave me the most important skill that I’ve had in my entire career: the ability to have normal, regular conversations with business people, because you are the intermediary, the gate-keeper: you keep them apart. My job was to interpret business and technical requirements and feed them back to each team appropriately. I was there for four years.</p>
        <p>A month after I got back from my honeymoon, the Senior Web Producer from the company down the road — who my best friend’s father had worked for, for his entire career — had just left. I was like, ‘<q>I have to have that job.</q>’ I basically went in and said that. I got it and I left the staffing company. This company is essentially a fifty-year-old health and wellness manufacturer of vitamins, and they had this brand philosophy of, ‘<q>we have to change the world.</q>’</p>
        <p>The company had recently been acquired and, as a result, many of the existing management left. The new owners brought in premier-league executives and my boss’ boss was the former CIO of Nike, Pepsi, and Gap. He fired my boss and all of a sudden I was leading a team that I was hired into six weeks earlier. ‘<q>Right, Alex, what do you think we should do?</q>’ I had to learn very quickly. I’ve never learned so much in my life.</p>
		<p class="question">What did you get from the experience?</p>
		<p class="answer">Contract negotiation, when to be a jerk and when to lay it on with the lovey-dovey, when to worry about things and when to just let it go, when to lay down your sword for this battle in an effort to win the war — just subtle things that you can’t teach; you have to observe a master doing it. I stayed at Shaklee for two years and I loved every second of it. It was exhausting, soul-destroying, and wonderful.</p>
		<p class="question">Let’s talk about Virgin America.</p>
		<p class="answer">When I heard that Virgin America was launching — they were originally going to launch in New York — I was like, ‘<q>Virgin and an airline and in America? Brilliant! Shame it’s in New York, because I wouldn’t want to move to New York.</q>’ They’re like, ‘<q>oh no, we’re building in San Francisco.</q>’</p>
        <p>I pulled every string I knew. Eventually, I got a call for an interview and I got the job of Manager of Interactive Marketing. At the time, there were thirty people employed at Virgin America. It was a massive risk because they had no airplanes and no certificate to fly.</p>
        <p>I’d just bought a really expensive house that I couldn’t afford — and which needed a substantial amount of investment to make it liveable — and I’d decided to go and work for an airline that doesn’t have any airplanes! I got the job in April 2006 and for reference, Virgin America didn’t start flying until 2007. My role was to complete the front-end website.</p>
        <p>On December 27, 2006 the Department of Transportation said no to the certificate. That was the single worst day of my life. I went to Arizona for New Year’s and just got wasted for three days. I kept thinking, ‘<q>we cannot let this happen.</q>’</p>
        <p>My commercial director was having the same thoughts. We put a programme together called ‘Let VA Fly.’ Up to that point, we’d never shown the product publicly, which was amazing. There was mood lighting and nine-inch touch screens with Maya TV, and you ordered your food on the airplane on-screen with wi-fi. It was revolutionary.</p>
        <p>We couldn’t show the product because we didn’t know when we were going to be able to fly and we didn’t want to give the competition a head-start on replicating our product. We couldn’t use Richard Branson — our most powerful marketing and brand tool (because technically US airlines can’t be owned by a foreigner) — so we built a website in a few days and we showed everything. We filmed videos of the CEO doing tours of the airplane. We built an application that allowed users to put in their postcode and it would send the form letter to their local congressman, state senator, the White House, and the Department of Transportation. 75,000 people did that.</p>
        <p>Actually that’s how we got involved with <a id="noterefAH001"></a><a href="#noteAH001" class="footnotelink">Diggnation <b>1</b></a>. We called them up and said, ‘<q>hey, we have a fun place for you to film an episode.</q>’ We’d never met them. It was a huge success and they became massive fans of the airline.</p>
        <p>On May 27, the Department of Transportation made an unprecedented reversal, overturning it and allowing us to fly. Virgin America started flying on August 8, 2007. We turned on the website — which was revolutionary for an airline website — and were hit with a six-and-a-half-hour denial of service attack. We never found out who was responsible for it, but it was an interesting thing to happen right as a new airline was launching.</p>

	<section class="content-block">
        <p>In October 2007 I was in New York, meeting with our agency, and I went to a launch party that Richard Branson attended. He said, ‘<q>you should come and do for Virgin what you did for Virgin America.</q>’ I was like, ‘<q>oh cool — but you’re going to forget this conversation.</q>’ Then I got a call from the lady who became my boss, saying, ‘<q>we’re looking for a Head of Online for Virgin and your name came up, so would you be interested in talking?</q>’ I said no because I’d just bought a house and I’d just launched Virgin America and they said, ‘<q>come down anyway and have a chat.</q>’ I met Richard on the San Francisco to Las Vegas flight I was on. He said to me again, ‘<q>you should just go and talk to them.</q>’ I did and they made clear their vision and I thought, ‘<q>we’ve been in California for seven years now and we should try it.</q>’ We moved over here in December that year and I started in January 2008 with the remit to own the digital strategy for Virgin, reinvent virgin.com, and be a consultant to the 200-plus companies around the world on digital — which is a massive job.</p>
        <p>The virgin.com platform has evolved substantially since I left, but the philosophy is still there and it seems to be working well. They’ve actually spun it off as a separate company.</p>

        <p>It was the hardest thing I’d ever done by orders of magnitude. Not only was I being the bridge between the businesses and our technical teams, but I was also doing my day job, which was working with the businesses to help them with digital strategy, managing the existing virgin.com site, and dealing with the requests from all the businesses.</p>
        <p>The philosophy behind the product was not that hard to come up with. We knew that we wanted a robust content management system behind it and we knew that we wanted a really powerful community element where people got involved, because people want to talk to Virgin; they want to be part of Virgin. What I had massively underestimated — as had everybody else on my team and my superiors — is the resistance that we would get from the businesses. I had to fly around the world for six months, selling this idea.</p>
		<p class="question">Is that because they felt they were losing part of their own identity?</p>
		<p class="answer">They thought we would be taking traffic from them, which was a completely bizarre notion. I cannot sell them the airplane tickets — you have to do that. I will just alert them to the fact that you sell them airplane tickets — you still have to fulfil that part. It was basically fear of the unknown. We launched, it went well, and traffic went straight up.</p>
		<p class="question">What made you move into working for yourself?</p>
		<p class="answer">I was about to turn thirty and I was like, ‘<q>you know, it’s time.</q>’ I’d launched this project, it was a massive weight off my shoulders, and I just knew. So I quit. I had no new job and nothing to go to apart from some speaking engagements in that September.</p>
        <p>I look back to that first talk in September 2009 as my rebirth. It was the most powerful speech that I’ve ever written. Kevin Rose tweeted out about the video and it just exploded. As a result I got a bunch of requests to speak — for free, initially — and then it just turned into a career. I surprise myself with what I want to talk about. I’ve inadvertently positioned myself as the marketing bullshit-buster.</p>
		<p class="question">If you’re speaking constantly, how do you stay ‘in the game?’</p>
		<p class="answer">You need to be relevant. You learn by doing and I’ve only started to speak about startups because I’ve started to build one. Rand Fishkin, who wrote SEOmoz, went for a round of funding and was ultimately unsuccessful. He wrote this warts-and-all blog post about all the things they did, learned, and would do differently. There’s something beautifully pure and transparent and wonderful about that.</p>
        <p>Initially, I talked about brand and the philosophy of loyalty. To be completely frank with you, depending on the audience, the message will shift. If I’m talking to marketers, I will tell them more about the emerging trends in digital and social — because  that’s what they want to hear and find out about. I spoke to a group of people from Procter & Gamble — they had all of their top people in the country come to this thing I spoke at. I was basically like, ‘<q>for the love of god, don’t think that social is going to save your business, because it’s not.</q>’ It’s just not — you have to deliver good products. They’re like, ‘oh, but what about Groupon?’ I’m like, ‘<q>don’t, unless you don’t want a business. Use it, but don’t put all your eggs in one basket.</q>’</p>
		<p class="question">What’s your take on startup culture in the US?</p>
		<p class="answer">It’s weird to me that you have these incubators spilling out 150 companies a quarter — how is that sustainable? How can you capture enough share of voice to make a dent, let alone an impact on an entire world?</p>
		<p class="question">It reminds us of that quote about the UK and America. Something like: you see a Rolls Royce in America and you think, ‘<q>one day, I will have that Rolls Royce.</q>’ You see a Rolls Royce in the UK and you get your key out and scratch it.</p>
		<p class="answer">Yeah, I think that’s absolutely true. There’s this sense of aspiration in the Valley that’s inspired by generation after generation of success. By mixing it with a little bit of the Californian optimism, you have that attitude.</p>

        <p>In the UK I think it’s a philosophical challenge. I also think it’s an infrastructure challenge as well. There aren’t enough people with money who understand our industry and the potential of ideas. You can hook and crook your way to £200,000, but if you needed to raise more money, you’re going to have to go to Western Europe or the US. Because getting it here’s going to be a needle in a haystack situation.</p>
        <p>How many ideas have died on the grapevine in the UK? Countless, because they haven’t had the mentoring. God bless things like Seedcamp. The financial support and the network of connections that you get from something like Seedcamp is incredible. They’re very good at letting the cream rise to the top, but not forgetting the people who perhaps weren’t as successful. I spent two months in California, I did the circuit, I sat with VCs, I talked to my friends who’d been through it in Silicon Valley — they’re all completely batshit insane.</p>
        <p>You turn on the tap and money comes out of it, but it’s not the right money. One of the VCs I spoke with said, ‘<q>I’m going to tell you all of the things you’re not supposed to know because you straddle the fence of investor and founder.</q>’</p>
		<p class="question">Even though there’s so much talent in the UK, it doesn’t feel like we have that culture here.</p>
		<p class="answer">What’s weird to me is that we don’t associate the big British success stories with being British. No-one goes, ‘<q>hey, did you know that so and so was from Somerset?</q>’ I think there’s a lack of understanding in the financial media and there’s a lack of understanding from the public.</p>
		<p class="question">Is startup culture a young person’s game?</p>
		<p class="answer">Yes. Because it requires an obscene amount of energy and caffeine. And naïvety! A sort of, ‘<q>I don’t know that I can’t do this. I haven’t been jaded by the world to be conditioned to assume that it will fail. I’m just going to do it because I feel like it.</q>’ There’s a lot to be said for that. There is. I mean there aren’t many of us who are in a position to say, ‘<q>I’m going to quit my day job and build this dream product.</q>’ You build it on the weekends; you build it in the evening before you have a partner and kids or whatever. I think you need to be maybe not so young of body, but certainly young of heart to do that. It’s difficult — it’s not an easy thing to do, but it’s fun. It’s liberating. I’ll never work for anybody else ever again.</p>
