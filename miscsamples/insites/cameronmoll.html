		<p class="question">We became aware of your work in the era of the CSS Zen Garden. What’s the story?</p>
		<p class="answer">I guess I started gaining recognition around 2003, which was a really interesting time. There was so much energy and it was just barely starting. At the time I was working for a small dot com with a team of about eighty or ninety people.</p>
        <p>We got small pretty fast after everything blew apart. We went from ten designers to three. I was the creative director at the time. Every Friday I’d set aside time where, for an hour, one of the team had to present. One of the guys on the team went to a conference where Jeffrey Zeldman, Jeff Veen, and others were presenting and he came back and presented the concept of Web Standards. This was probably 2001.</p>
        <p>It was completely new to me and completely foreign to our team, but we bought into it pretty quickly. Before long we were developing all of our client work with CSS to the best of our ability. It was a nightmare back then to develop CSS well, but I found it completely fascinating.</p>
        <p>I’ve always enjoyed sharing what I learn as I go. Around that time many of us were setting up blogs. People like Doug Bowman and Dan Cederholm were experimenting with this whole idea of blogging and for me my site was a great avenue through which I could share my experiences.</p>
        <p>I get asked a question all the time now at conferences and I think it’s similar to the one I’m talking about here: <q>‘how can I do what you did?’</q> And I always say: find a voice and a passion, and establish yourself not just as a designer, but as someone who’s a design leader.</p>
		<p class="question">Is that harder to achieve now? Aren’t we at saturation point?</p>
		<p class="answer">Absolutely. That’s the first thing I say when I try to answer the question I just mentioned. It’s in part that I got lucky. I got in at the right time and I was ahead of the ball by understanding what standards were in CSS, but the other half is to just write about something you’re passionate about and who knows what’s going to come after that. That’s what I was doing: I wasn’t writing with the intent to become a conference speaker or author; I was writing because I had a passion for CSS-based design and I wanted to share that.</p>

		<p class="question">What’s your background?</p>
		<p class="answer">I didn’t have the fortune of going through art school. I didn’t take any design classes at high school or college. I’m completely self-taught. It kind of sounds cool when it rolls off the tongue, but actually I’m not too proud of it nowadays. I wish I had the art background and a better understanding of some of the fundamentals of things such as grids, as it would’ve saved me a lot of time.</p>
        <p>I was in college and my degree was in business management. I thought I would become a VP of some company and climb the ranks. My emphasis in the programme was marketing — I think that really helped with the entrepreneurial stuff. To understand a customer is very similar to understanding a user. What makes people tick, or what makes them purchase and what doesn’t. Creating stuff doesn’t fundamentally change for me from one medium to another. It’s all about synthesising ideas in the mind and executing them.</p>
		<p class="question">What happened after the collapse of the dot com?</p>
		<p class="answer">I was in school full-time as well as working full-time at the dot com, and then I had three kids when I graduated. I never want to go back to that period of my life—I’m glad I did it, but it was very challenging. When I left the dot com, I had the degree in business management with an emphasis on marketing, and I knew quite a bit about design, so I thought I’d see if I could merge the two. I went to a medical software company to be their marketing manager, where I was doing both design and marketing campaigns. It was really an attempt to blend the two.</p>

        <p>I quickly found out — I was only there for a year — that the life of a marketing manager was not the life I wanted to lead, at least not at that point in my life. I spent more time in Excel running numbers on how the campaigns performed than I did doing actual design. I found that I just didn’t enjoy that so I left that company after about a year.</p>
        <p>I was blogging, doing some freelance work on the side, and I figured I had enough traction to make the leap into freelancing. This was around 2004. I look back now and I wonder what in the world I was thinking! I had a family of five to support, my wife was not working, it was just me, I’d never done freelancing, and I was still learning how to do design. Fortunately it worked out really well.</p>
        <p>After about eighteen months of freelancing, I realised that I was hitting a wall, financially speaking, by doing only client work. It’s not that it’s impossible to make a living from client work, but for me — especially being the sole provider — it was very hard to time payments from clients with the bills I had to meet as a father, husband, and business-owner. I saw an escape through residual income of some sort. Thankfully I’d been hosting these job listings in the sidebar on my site. I’d already been doing that for a few months before the idea of Authentic Jobs came about.</p>
		<p class="question">Did people just approach you?</p>
		<p class="answer">Yeah. Every now and again a VP or a hiring manager at Apple would come in and say, ‘<q>Cameron, are you interested in taking this position at Apple?</q>’ And usually it was, ‘<q>no, I’ll pass for now.</q>’ Then they’d almost always ask, ‘<q>well, do you know anyone in the industry you could refer me to?</q>’ Again, most people I knew were busy or not interested. I’d say to them, ‘I’ll just throw a mention in my sidebar, saying, “<q>Apple is looking to hire so- and-so; contact this person if you’re interested.</q>”’ That picked up quite a bit. 37Signals definitely capitalised on the idea first and they launched a paid service that still exists today. I’m like, ‘<q>well, they kind of took my idea — I’m going to take it back,</q>’ and launched my site. Authentic was a kind of brand for me at the time, so I decided to call it Authentic Jobs.</p>
		<p class="question">With Authentic Jobs on the side, you spent the next three or four years working at the LDS Church in Salt Lake City, Utah. What made you move back to freelancing?</p>
		<p class="answer">I was itching to do more design than and I also felt that I wasn’t able to contribute as much as I’d like. I looked at freelancing again as an opportunity to do that.</p>

					<p>When I go to a conference and someone comes up to me to say, ‘<q>I got my last job through Authentic Jobs,</q>’ or, ‘<q>I got my last hire through Authentic Jobs,</q>’ that’s just unbelievable.</p>

		<!-- END a Pullquote figure //-->
		
        <p>I knew at that point I didn’t want to work for someone else. I wanted to get to a point where I could control what I was working on and the direction of whatever I was working on. That also meant taking a hard look at client services and saying, ‘<q>do I really want to go back to client work if that’s what I’ve been doing for the last three years?</q>’</p>
        <p>Authentic Jobs had been growing all that time, my letterpress poster business had been doing well, and after many conversations with my wife about making it work, we said, ‘<q>let’s just try it.</q>’ Even then, I didn’t know if Authentic Jobs, the letterpress posters, and speaking were enough to sustain me again as a sole provider, but we thought we’d try. I took on one client out of the gates, just as a safety net, but within a few months I didn’t really have to worry about that stuff again.</p>
		<p class="question">Had Authentic Jobs continued to grow when you were running it as a side project?</p>
		<p class="answer">At that time — this was two years ago — it was still growing steadily. Thankfully, it’s allowed me to provide for a family of now six.</p>
        <p>What’s always been important to me with Authentic jobs and really anything I do — maybe that’s the reason I chose the name ‘Authentic’ in the first place — is that I try to be very transparent and very real about the stuff I produce. Long before it was a commercial entity, it was all about this pro bono thing of just wanting to help companies find great designers. Now that it’s a commercial entity, I’ve tried to not lose focus. My whole reason for existing is to connect companies to great talent, so if we’re not doing that, Authentic Jobs don’t want to take your money.</p>

        <p>We’ve never been based on volume — we’re not a Monster or a Craig’s List where the focus is on getting lots of applicants. We’re more focused on quality of applicants. If we only send over two guys, one or both of those two could potentially be a hire. What’s happening right now is you have every company on the planet wanting designers, developers, etc., so everybody’s hiring. On the flip-side of that, most of us are not looking for work: we’re happy where we are, we’re going to startups, we’re starting up our own thing, we’re freelancing full-time, or if we’re concerned about the future, we’re staying put. People are just not applying for work like they used to.</p>
        <p>That’s been a really interesting challenge to wrestle with — that’s where <a id="noterefCM001"></a><a href="#noteCM001" class="footnotelink">Authentic Crew <b>1</b></a> (the sister site of Authentic Jobs) has come from. It’s trying to address the need to connect candidates and employers more dynamically. You don’t post and pray that someone applies — you post and have access to people who are available and demonstrate what skills they have.</p>
		<p class="question">There’s a perception that working in a distributed team is somehow easy. How do you cope with not only having a remote team, but all being in different time zones?</p>

		<!-- START a Pullquote figure //-->

		<p class="answer">It’s been challenging and I’ve learned a great deal in the last two years about distributed teams. I think there are definitely both pros and cons. We all look at distributed teams as being the ideal, but they also present challenges.</p>
        <p>It’s hard to beat sitting down face-to-face with someone, in many respects. The thing you can’t get through Skype and IM is just what happens in a physical conversation. I could present an idea through text or a phone call, but I can’t tell how that person is really reacting to the idea without seeing their face. There’s definitely something to be said for meeting people in person, seeing them, bouncing ideas off them, analysing their reactions, and picking up on those subtle cues.</p>
		<p class="question">We touched on the Authentic Crew project. It’s been a long time in the making, hasn’t it?</p>
		<p class="answer">We’ve been developing it for about a year and a half. I did the first sketches almost three years ago. One of the things I’ve learned is that I’m a horrible project manager and that’s part of the reason it’s taken so long. But we can finally see the light at the end of the tunnel. In today’s hiring market, you’ve got to be more proactive and you’ve got to be where the candidates are. We also think the hiring process is lopsided, with too much focus on candidate transparency. Usually the interview process involves candidates telling everything about themselves, while the company tells very little about itself. We want to help companies expose themselves as much as candidates do.</p>

        <p>So at Authentic Crew what’s next is for us to continue to connect companies with great talent: web talent, specifically. That’s been our mission statement from day one. We’ve never said, ‘<q>we are a job board.</q>’ We’ve always been about connecting companies with individuals. So, right now we’re a job board, but soon we’ll expand to offer a database of creative profiles. Who knows what the next iteration will be!</p>
		<p class="question">How do you know if someone’s been hired through Authentic Jobs? Do you reach out to companies and applicants, or do people just get in touch to say thank you?</p>
		<p class="answer">Yeah, we do pride ourselves in hearing those stories. Usually it’s people tweeting or sending an email saying, ‘<q>we’ve filled the position, thank you</q>’. What’s even better than that is when I go to a conference and someone comes up to me to say, ‘<q>I got my last job through Authentic Jobs,</q>’ or, ‘<q>I got my last hire through Authentic Jobs.</q>’ That’s just unbelievable.</p>
