		<p class="question">You didn’t start working in digital until you were into your thirties. Tell us a little bit of the backstory.</p>
		<p class="answer">Some people have five-year plans, but I’m not a list-maker. I left school without any qualifications. I didn’t really try as hard as I could have — I just didn’t see the point in a lot of it. After leaving school my dad got me a job at the local news agency as a photographer. I did that for a couple of years, but I was always into computers.</p>
        <p>At school, having an interest in computers was never encouraged because it was so new. People didn’t understand the importance of it or the effect it was going to have on our lives. We had just one computer in the whole school, which was used by the A-streamers. I wasn’t one of them.</p>
        <p>When I stopped doing photography I got into music. I became a DJ and started to make breakbeat albums for a record company in London. I earned no money at all doing this.</p>
        <p>One day I took the cassette with my demos on into the 3 Beat Music record shop in Liverpool, as I’d heard they had a little record label. I left the tape with them and asked if they could have a listen to it. When I got home that evening from my job in the factory, Lisa — who was my girlfriend at the time — told me I’d had a phone call from them to say that they really loved the tape and wanted to put it out as a 12-inch single. I thought, ‘<q>this is it. I don’t need to work in a factory, I’m going to make millions!</q>’ I made £400. I started doing gigs at Cream and it was cool, but it was just me on stage pretending to play a keyboard — I had to make it look a bit better.</p>
        <p>I did a couple of tours—I think I was in the Top Ten in New York for a weekend — but it wasn’t working out because I had no money, I was still working in a factory at night, and I’d been there for eight years up until I was almost thirty. One day my Dad brought home a computer called a Macintosh and it had software called ‘Photoshop’, and I thought, ‘<q>what the hell is this?</q>’ This was in 1994 or 1995 and this thing called ‘the web’ was really starting to take off.</p>
        <p>At that time Kai Krause had a lot of tips and tricks online on how to learn Photoshop and I downloaded things from there, printed them out and worked through them all. I didn’t own a computer myself, so I had to go to my Dad’s to borrow his Mac and teach myself all of this in the evenings and at weekends.</p>
        <p>A company called Subnet came to the fore around this time. One day at the factory I rang them up to ask if they were looking to hire. They told me to come in to have a chat. At this point I’d built a couple of websites myself, including one about the 1960s TV show The Outer Limits, so I had something to show them.</p>
        <p>When I went to meet them I found that they were just a group of lads who had decided that they were going to do this web thing, and they offered me a job! So I said yes even though it was a fifty percent pay drop. My wife Lisa said, ‘<q>this is what you want to do, so we’ll find a way.</q>’ So that’s what I did.</p>

        <p>Talk about influence of environment and being in the right place at the right time. The key thing for Subnet was that they were in an old mill on an old industrial estate in Burnley — not exactly Silicon Valley. They were in the same building at the time as Club 18-30’s headquarters. Just before I joined, Club 18-30 knocked on the door and requested that Subnet make them a website that looked like their stickers. That was the brief. Club 18-30 has a massive reputation and that was what made Subnet go stellar. Suddenly everyone knew us. I discovered Flash over the course of a weekend, brought it to the company, and told them that I wanted to introduce it to our work. We then did three 18-30 sites off the back of that. Then we got Coca-Cola, and after that we got Disney.</p>
        <p>Subnet were nominated for an award at that year’s Macromedia web conference in Euro Disney, Paris. During the conference I saw Hillman Curtis speak and I thought he was amazing. He had just left Macromedia as their art director to set up his own company, and he was doing motion graphics in Flash. No-one had seen anything like it before.</p>
        <p>During his talk he mentioned Saul Bass, who I’d done a site about. I went up to Hillman like some fanboy and asked if he could have a look at my site. We started chatting via email and he told me that he really loved the site and that he was going to be doing a talk in Seattle and did I want to go on stage with him? He said he could probably pay for my flight. In those situations, you just have to say yes whether you can afford it or not. I thought, ‘<q>this might actually change my life.</q>’ And it did.</p>
        <p>In 2000 I decided that my time at Subnet was done; I’d been there for four years. Hillman and I did Flash Forward in New York and from there, that was it. My life completely changed from that point on.</p>
        <p>I still remember being in the New Yorker Hotel — it was the second Flash Forward conference and the first one in New York. Hillman introduced me to Josh Davis and Branden Hall. I look back and think, ‘<q>that was quite an amazing time.</q>’</p>

		<p class="question">Then you joined magneticNorth as creative director?</p>
		<p class="answer">Yes and I eventually became a director. It was very much an advertising, marketing and digital company at the time, and I wanted to make interfaces, so that’s where I tried to steer it, and that’s what they do now.</p>
		<p class="question">It sounds like you’ve embraced the possibilities of new tech- nologies throughout your career. Does learning come easily to you or are you a methodical learner?</p>
		<p class="answer">I’m not methodical — just look at my code! I’ll think, ‘<q>right, I’m going to do it like this.</q>’ Code just makes sense to me.</p>
        <p>I only ever did one course in programming at a night school before I got into the web. They gave us a task of separating vowels from consonants. It was quite a challenge, but me being me, of course, I did it animated. The teacher asked if I’d done it before, and I said, ‘<q>no, I just worked it out. It’s all numbers, really, isn’t it?</q>’ Everyone was crowding around my computer, looking at it. It was a bit embarrassing in some ways!</p>
		<p class="question">Code and visual creativity don’t always go hand in hand. Is that something that came naturally to you?</p>
        <p class="answer">It just happens to be how I think. I think that some of the best programmers really understand aesthetics.</p>
        <p>When I was at Subnet I was doing Javascript, but I wanted to move graphics around. The tool to do that at the time was Director. I would make some graphics and then have to give it to Pete, who would program it in Lingo; but sometimes he was busy, so I taught myself Lingo born out of frustration. I think it all stems from that.</p>
        <p class="question">At magneticNorth did you get involved in the pitching process, or was the work doing the talking?</p>
        <p class="answer">It’s still a battle and we always have to pitch, which is one of the reasons why I’m now changing what I’m doing. I don’t want to pitch anymore.</p>

        <p>It’s frustrating. Let’s say you’ve got a good reputation because you’ve done really big sites and you’re pitching to a returning client — if it’s to a different department it’s almost like you just learned web design a week ago. You constantly have to prove that you can do your work, even after just having done a massive site very well. If you didn’t pitch, you didn’t get the work.</p>
        <p>With regards to getting the work initially or even just being asked to pitch, it is about reputation and putting the work out there and being known for — in magneticNorth’s case — taking a few risks, or being experimental. A lot of what I do is to get stuff out there and get people talking about it.</p>
		<p class="question">What did the role of creative director entail?</p>
		<p class="answer">In your head you know the kind of vision for the project from the outset and what the client is buying into, but it’s your job to steer the process in the right direction to make sure it gets to the end goal.</p>
        <p>From an art direction point of view, you’re facilitating the team because you realise that there are people who are way more talented than you, who are much better at programming. So rather than doing it yourself, as creative director, your job is to meld all of those things together to make sure it all fits together as it was originally intended.</p>
		<p class="question">Tell us about some of your early influences.</p>
		<p class="answer">I strongly believe that you’re very influenced by the way you grew up and the types of things you do as a kid. The thing that really influenced me was growing up in the town I still live in. It’s a seaside town where there were loads of video arcades. Growing up, this machine called ‘Space Invaders’ suddenly arrived. You don’t think about things like this becoming import- ant one day. I spent all my time there and all of my weekends. It taught me the importance of the whole multimedia experience.</p>

 

		<p>There was this one video arcade and it had no fruit machines; it was just a video arcade with Defender and Galaga in the basement of a hotel. All the windows were blacked out and there was UV light— you walked in and were hit with all these sounds. There was a physical nature of playing a video game.</p>
		<p class="question">How did MoviePeg come about?</p>
		<p class="answer">I was coming back from London on a train and I was trying to watch a film on my phone. I was propping it up on my bag and I thought, ‘<q>there’s got to be a better way to do this</q>’.</p>
        <p>I sketched something out and realised that I was going to have to cut the design out of wood. It wasn’t a business idea; I just wanted to make this for myself. I did a prototype at home out of cardboard and thought, ‘<q>I think I can sell them.</q>’</p>
        <p>We set about finding out how we’d get it made and we launched it at South by Southwest. It went really well and we now ship to seventy countries and retail stores all over the world. We’ve also got a bigger one for iPads and tablets.</p>
		<p class="question">How did it go from being a design agency to moving into an online fulfilment business?</p>
        <p class="answer">I love running the shop. It’s great. I’m really into good customer service — trying to keep the customers happy and go the extra mile. It’s amazing that we’ve got all of this technology and it enables one person to do stuff that you would not be able to do even just a year ago. Our shop is on Shopify, which is the most amazing e-commerce system out of the box — the support is just incredible.</p>
		<p class="question">What motivated you to do use KickStarter when you launched POPA?</p>
		<p class="answer">We wanted a way to launch it that would raise funding for the project. We had to set up an American company with an American bank account‚ which was very stressful. We’d done a really slick video that we thought would go down really well with Kickstarter, and we’d already spoken to them about it. We uploaded the video, ready to go, but a day later found out that Kickstarter had rejected it. I couldn’t believe it because I thought it was so right for them as a product and it was a great video. It was a horrible weekend. Kate got in touch with them to ask them why they wouldn’t accept our video, and they said it was because we hadn’t got a US bank account. We told them that we did, so they gave the go-ahead!</p>
        <p>We put the whole thing live while I was doing a talk in Austria. At the time I was sitting in a crappy hotel foyer because the wi-fi wouldn’t work in the room that I had. When it went live people started to tweet and over the course of about a day we were up to $8,000 — we only wanted $20,000! I boarded the plane to leave Austria and when we landed I switched on my phone and received a text message saying that it had been linked to on Daring Fireball and the additional traffic from that had brought the server down. When we eventually got the server back up, the figure tipped to over $20,000. This was in just forty-eight hours.</p>
		<p class="question">What was the final figure?</p>
		<p class="answer">$48,000. Way over double what we were aiming for. It was a great experience and we got so much PR out of it.</p>
        <p>The reaction has been amazing. Matt Jones at Berg said it was the most beautiful thing he’d ever seen. Someone else said that his iPhone camera experience is now 200 percent better. You do get the odd complaint, but you can’t please everyone.</p>
		<p class="question">You had to change the name, though — what was POPA called originally?</p>
		<p class="answer">Red Pop, because my dad had red hair. He died in 2007 and I don’t visit the grave. It’s just not for me; I don’t need to visit a stone to remember him. POPA is my way of immortalising him.
        <p>POPA is the thing I’m most proud of. From an interaction design point of view, it was a culmination of what I’ve learned and what I love about physical things, right from arcade machines to everything else I’ve learned since.</p>
		<p class="question">All of the things you’ve made for fun are great examples that you can actually make something that people want to buy, and from that you can become commercially successful.</p>
		<p class="answer">What I love about the iPhone, weirdly, is the lack of affordance — they’re just a piece of glass and metal. They don’t communicate what they do when they’re off. You don’t look at it and think, ‘<q>that’s a phone.</q>’ You look at a cup and it’s a cup and always will be, and you look at an old phone and it’ll always be a phone, whereas iPhones and devices like them are just devices waiting for you to make them into something else. Usually that’s from a software point of view, but what we’ve done is to try to add some hardware.</p>
        <p>I’m a modernist and a fan of the Bauhaus, but the Bauhaus kind of fails — I don’t believe that people just want very stark objects like that. People like texture and feel.</p>
