		<p class="question">How did you start out professionally and how did that lead to where you are now?</p>
        <p class="answer">I went to a small college in Virginia to study literature. I always loved writing and didn’t have the kinds of parents that thought I should go to school for something that would get me a job. I took every literature class I could, but as an undergraduate you have other curriculum requirements you had to fill, so I signed up for physics.</p>
        <p class="answer">I unexpectedly found that physics was my favourite class that semester. It was the most challenging, because it was such a different way of using my brain. I liked the back-and- forth between writing a paper on Shakespeare and then taking a break to think through a physics problem and solve it. I approached a number of my professors and asked, ‘<q>what do you think about me doing two majors — both English and physics?</q>’ The response I got was overwhelmingly supportive.</p>
		<p class="question">Did that mean twice the amount of work?</p>
        <p class="answer">Yeah, I did all the degree requirements for both English and physics in four years. It was extremely challenging and I missed out on a lot of things, but the experience of being in those two very different fields was really powerful to me.</p>
        <p class="answer">Before my last year I won a fellowship to work for the Department of Energy at a local nuclear accelerator facility. It was my first time I was doing real physics, and it was absolutely dreadful. I was underground all day long with people who were extremely smart, but I knew I didn’t belong.</p>
        <p class="answer">So I graduated from college with a useless physics degree. I also had this English major, and if you graduate with an English major, then you move to New York and work in publishing, so that’s what I did. I interviewed at all of the big publishing houses, and every time it was the same: you’d show up and there would be twenty-two other college graduates, all lined up to interview for the same editorial assistant job. And you never got to talk to a real person; you talked to an HR person and they always wanted you to take a typing test.</p>
        <p class="answer">I was dismayed with the whole process and, frankly, really cocky about who I was and what I was doing with my life at that point. For one interview, I arrived and there were all these other kids in the hallway, and the HR person came out and said, ‘<q>oh, we need you to take a typing test.</q>’ I said, ‘<q>I’m not taking a typing test. When am I getting the interview?</q>’ I went through the interview very quickly and then (surprise!) I got a letter the very next day saying, ‘<q>We are not hiring you for this job.</q>’</p>
		<p class="question">That’ll teach you!</p>
        <p class="answer">It wasn’t meant to be cocky. By luck, I met a gentleman from Seven Stories Press, which back then was a tiny little press. They were independent, a little bit punk, and really interesting. Vonnegut published his last couple of books with them.</p>

        <p class="answer">He was the first person I met out of all of these ridiculous interviews who really cared about books and words, and was doing this because it mattered to him. He couldn’t hire me at the time, but he put me in touch with some of his former colleagues at Norton — the publisher of the Norton Anthologies — and I met with them. Immediately it felt like, ‘<q>this is a real house with people who care about books and who are making decisions based on what matters, not bullshit marketing jargon.</q>’</p>
        <p class="answer">I had listed on my resumé that I knew Quark. Now, this was not true. I knew a teeny, tiny bit of PageMaker — having worked as an editor for my undergraduate literary magazine, mostly observing someone else who did things in PageMaker. But I landed the job because of that fib: they needed someone who could do both copywriting and layout work. I very quickly taught myself Quark. </p>
        <p class="answer">The job was in the advertising department, so I spent a lot of time making black-and-white, one-sheet ads; things that would go in an architecture journal, for example. I didn’t really know what I was doing with layout work, but that made me like it that much more. The copywriting I was good at, but it wasn’t necessarily challenging. So I read some books on design, I took a couple of continuing education classes at some of the universities in the city. I had — as someone who’d been reading for the better part of her life at that point — a good instinct for what made text look good, so I was able to pick it up relatively quickly. I graduated from doing these really mediocre, one-sheet, black-and-white ads to doing book catalogues and working on some of the books. I eventually took over the whole department to run it from both a design side and from a business side.</p>

		<p class="question">What period was that, from entry level to running the place?</p>
        <p class="answer">I started running the department about two-and-a-half to three years in. I think I was promoted or had my title changed an average of every eight months while I was at Norton. Which says a lot about me, but it says a lot about Norton, too: they were the kind of place that promoted from within almost exclusively, and they rewarded people who wanted to try new things.</p>
        <p class="answer">Meanwhile, I taught myself web design. For a while I thought code was something I shouldn’t do, but eventually I read a couple of books (including Zeldman’s Designing with Web Standards) and realised that the code wasn’t that hard and actually made a lot more sense once you understood what’s going on. I taught myself HTML and CSS and eventually took over the website team at Norton. The last big project I did there was hiring Happy Cog and working with them to redesign the website.</p>

		<p class="question">What was the time scale from hiring Happy Cog to your leaving?</p>
        <p class="answer">We hired them in the Fall of 2007 and then I left in January 2010. It took Happy Cog about four months to design and build the site, but it took Norton the next eighteen months after that to actually launch it. After I founded A Book Apart with Jason and Jeffrey, I moved on from Norton.</p>
		<p class="question">Was the intention to move on to A Book Apart as your sole income stream, or had you decided to do other things as well?</p>
        <p class="answer">Other things. We published Jeremy’s book and it went phenomenally well, but it still didn’t feel like the kind of income I could rely on solely. And I didn’t want to just be an editor — I wanted to be one of the people we were publishing for. A position opened up at Typekit, and I said to Jason, ‘<q>so, tell me about this whole Typekit situation.</q>’ He had nothing but extraordinary things to say about the team. He introduced me to Jeff Veen, and the rest is history.</p>
￼￼
		<p class="question">We’re really interested in the genesis of A Book Apart. What made you decide to go ahead and actually do it?</p>
        <p class="answer">Jeffrey had this fantastic idea to do short books — longer than an essay, but not 300 pages long. It was a great idea, both from the content side, and also in terms of running a different kind of publishing house. We spent a lot of time researching printing and shipping and ebooks and so on, trying to figure out how to pull it off without losing our shirts.</p>
        <p class="answer">Around the same time, Jeremy Keith wrote one or two blog posts where he talked about what it meant that XHTML 2 had been killed and that this was the right thing, and that the way we were now approaching HTML5 made so much more sense. His posts were calm and clear and just cut through the bullshit. The three of us turned to each other within twenty-four hours of Jeremy’s posts and said, ‘<q>we need to do a book on HTML5 and only Jeremy Keith can write it.</q>’ Then we approached Jeremy and said, ‘<q>we want you to write a book for this publishing house that doesn’t exist yet and we’re not going to pay you until the book comes out. But when the book comes out, we’re going to give you half.</q>’ Much to our surprise, he said yes.</p>
        <p class="answer">HTML5 for Web Designers was — and remains — a big success because we had the right topic and the right brand and the right time — people really needed it. Jason’s design felt canonical from the beginning. There was just something really powerful about the whole thing.</p>
		<p class="question">How did you juggle your role at Typekit at the same time?</p>
        <p class="answer">Typekit knew about A Book Apart from the beginning; I was very clear that that was part of my life, and they were supportive of it. To be honest, I have a vision of leisure time that most people would classify as work. I get up early and I work late and I work weekends and I take work away with me on holidays. A lot of people think that’s a terrible thing, but I love what I’m doing, so I’m grateful for the opportunity to work on something great.</p>

        <p class="answer">I think I’ve also learned how to be efficient and how to delegate effectively and to understand the right way to approach a project. If I’m doing something I haven’t done before, I know it’s going to take me a lot of time. Once I’ve done it a few times, I can probably do it quickly. And once I’ve built a system for it, it’s time to find someone else to do it. It’s hard to grasp, but when you get really good at something, often that means it’s time to move on.</p>

		<p class="question">What drives you to take on personal, unpaid projects, like <a id="noterefMB001"></a><a href="#noteMB001" class="footnotelink">Made by Hand <b>1</b></a> or <a id="noterefMB002"></a><a href="#noteMB002" class="footnotelink">your own blog <b>2</b></a>?</p>
        <p class="answer">It’s hard for me to distinguish between personal and non- personal projects. It’s more about priorities. I do the things I do just because I want to do them, because they’re exciting or challenging. Some things naturally make it to the bottom of the pile because I have to keep a roof over my head, but a lot of it is either the people or the compulsion.</p>
        <p class="answer">A Working Library is a compulsion: I’m going to read books and I’m going to scribble about them, so I might as well scribble them in the public sphere. Blogging is a kind of idea-generation and brainstorming that happens in public.</p>
        <p class="answer">You get to talk about something when it’s still really early and there’s something very valuable about that.</p>
        <p class="answer">The appeal of Made By Hand was working with my husband, Keith Ehrlich: we’ve done little things over the years and we wanted to do something else together. The topic energised us both, and it’s the type of content on the web you don’t see much of. Could we convince people that beautiful, cinematic film belongs on the web alongside the cat photos? I like ambitious projects.</p>
		<p class="question">How important do you think Studiomates, Brooklyn, or New York as a whole has been for the success of your projects?</p>
        <p class="answer">I wouldn’t be I’d be where I am today if it weren’t for Studiomates — there’s an incredible amount of generosity in the studio, but also in the web industry here. It’s indispensible.</p>
        <p class="answer">In part, that’s because there isn’t a sense of competition. Rather, there’s general feeling that everyone wants everyone else to do as well or better than they are. I’m not certain where that comes from or exactly how we sustain it, but I’m going to do my best to continue to embody it — to pay it back as best as I can.</p>
