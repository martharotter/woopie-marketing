		<p class="question">Let’s start at the beginning: how did Swiss Miss end up in NYC?</p>
        <p class="answer">I was studying graphic design in Munich, Germany, and decided to do a summer internship in San Francisco at a small web agency — this was in 1998. On my way back, I stopped in New York for two days and — oh my god — I got into the subway, got out in Manhattan, and I literally fell in love with the place.</p>
        <p>All I kept saying was, <i>‘I have to live here, people talk as fast as me here, they walk as fast as me here, and I don’t drive anyone nuts.’</i> In Switzerland everything is so slow. I always felt like I had to slow down because I could never be at the pace I wanted to be. I arrived in New York and thought, <i>‘I’ve found my home!’</i>
        <p class="question">You didn’t feel that in San Francisco?</p>
        <p class="answer">No, not at all. In fall of 1999 I graduated from design school in Munich. I had a job lined up in Zurich and a share in a really nice apartment, but I totally burned out and I said to my parents, <i>‘please, just let me go to New York for three months.’</i> I was convinced I was coming back, so I just threw my stuff into temporary storage.</p>
        <p>I had one interview lined up. I got here on a Monday night and on Tuesday morning at ten, this interview was happening in downtown Manhattan. It was this really small design studio that doesn’t exist anymore. Two minutes into our conversation, he said, <i>‘first of all, you will never leave New York. Trust me.’</i> I was like, <i>‘what a cocky bastard! How can you say that about me?’</i> Then he said, <i>‘And secondly, just sit down. You have an internship’.</i></p>
        <p>Two weeks later they offered me a full-time job with a visa. I became ‘the web girl’ in that studio. Whenever there was a web project, I was put on it, which was really cool.</p>
        <p class="question">Were you working at that studio on 9/11?</p>
        <p class="answer"> Yeah, I was there. I was one of those people who were covered from head to toe in white dust while running away from the falling towers. It was a rough day. We couldn’t go back into the studio for three weeks and that was the end of it.</p>
        <p>It was really bad timing because I’d just got my own one- bedroom apartment. I signed a lease on September 1st and I was due to move in on the 15th. Then 9/11 happened. I didn’t know then that I was losing my job, but I had a feeling. It took me a year to find a new job; that year was the toughest year of my life. Eventually it all worked out and I found a job at a really cool company about a year later called Plum Design, which then became Thinkmap.</p>
        <p class="question">Had you started Swiss Miss by then?</p>
        <p class="answer">I started Swiss Miss in 2005 when I worked at Thinkmap. Like a typical designer I would find stuff online and bookmark it. People would come to me and ask, <i>‘what was that thing you sent me?’</i> — because back then you’d share everything through email — and I could never find anything. I realised, <i>‘I need a visual archive’.</i></p>
        <p>So I started Swiss Miss as a visual archive for myself. I remember sitting there: when you sign up on TypePad you need to have a username and it was a split-second decision. I thought, <i>‘people call me Swiss Miss — sure, why not?’</i> There was no strategy behind this whole thing and I had no idea that it would stick. A few months in, my friend asked, <i>‘check your stats because I see people linking to you.’</i></p>
        <p>Once I paid attention to my visitor stats, I realised people were interested in this; then I began to take it a little more seriously!</p>
        <p class="question">When did you decide to focus purely on your own website?</p>
        <p class="answer">When I was pregnant with my son, I looked at my husband and said, <i>‘you know, I really want to go on a one-year client sabbatical. I just want to try to have no clients and work on my own projects.’</i> I was pretty sure I could ramp up my income a bit more on my blog and I could just about pay my bills. I asked him, <i>‘if ever there’s a month where I can’t pay all of what I’m supposed to, can you help me out?’</i> And he said yes.</p>

        <p>My accountant just shakes his head when he sees my balance. Like, <i>‘you are the most confusing income-generator I know.’</i> My blog is definitely the biggest job. I have <a id="noterefTRE001"></a><a href="#noteTRE001" class="footnotelink">The Deck Network <b>1</b></a> income, which is stable, and the <a id="noterefTRE002"></a><a href="#noteTRE002" class="footnotelink">Authentic Jobs listing <b>2</b></a>, which fluctuates depending on how much traffic I send. I’m not getting rich. I’m just happy I can cover my costs. I have so much traffic I could sell out and sell more ads, but I just can’t do it to my readers. I don’t want to be known as ‘the blogger who sold out’. I keep pushing back on a lot of sponsors, but they keep approaching me.</p>
        <p>It makes me so happy when people ask, <i>‘what? You’re making money off your blog? You have ads?’</i> That’s the best compliment I could get — that they don’t even see ads. It’s so subtle.</p>

        <p class="question">How did Studiomates come about? Was it another case of you realising you had to put up or shut up?</p>
        <p class="answer">After I rented desks for about six months in different spaces,￼I just realised that I really wanted to create my own space. I had this vision of being in a space where we have enough room that people can drop in — a very, open, welcoming environment. The last space I was at was beautiful, but if I wanted someone to come in and sit with me, I had to ask permission.</p>
        <p>I had this vision of a space that was big enough to rent out desks to like-minded, entrepreneurial people. I just know that when I surround myself with smart, driven folks, good things will come of it. That’s kind of the premise that I had, so I started looking for an office space and found what is now Studiomates.</p>
        <p>Some people ask, <i>‘when you say co-working space, do you have to work together?’</i> No, of course not. But collaboration happens. Mike and Skylar built Tattly for me. They branded and built Quarterly and Larry helped us to do the TeuxDeux iPhone app. There’s so much going on right now. Is there anything that’s better than working with friends when they’re right next to you? No.</p>
        <p class="question">How did TeuxDeux come about?</p>
        <p class="answer">Well, this is the best part of Studiomates. Teuxdeux was born over a lunch conversation. We discussed to-do apps that everyone was using and I sketched out my personal system, which was at the time entirely paper-based. I told <a id="noterefTRE003"></a><a href="#noteTRE003" class="footnotelink">Cameron <b>3</b></a> how I wished it lived on the web. He looked at me and said, <i>‘Tina, design it and I’ll build it.’</i> It took me three hours, I sent the Photoshop mockups to Cameron, and twenty-four hours later the working prototype was up. A few weeks later we built a small marketing site and let people sign up and use it, all for free.</p>

        <p>I blogged about it in December of 2009 and within hours we had sign-ups by the thousands. Fast Company wrote about it an hour after we officially launched it, saying, <i>‘it’s the most beautiful to-do app of 2009.’</i> Looking back at that morning I keep thinking that the internet went all kinds of magical on us. Teuxdeux is a perfect example on why we should all take our side projects more seriously.</p>

        <p class="question">Tell us a bit about CreativeMornings — how did that start?</p>
        <p class="answer">CreativeMornings came out of a personal rule of mine that if I keep complaining about something, I need to change it or move on. I started to realise that the conference world — as it appears to me — is broken. You spend too much time and too much money on something that’s very not inclusive.</p>
        <p>I would go to all these conferences and I would see ten speakers a day, which is too much. What I really wanted to do was connect with people. I realised that there has to be something more accessible and nimble and more community-driven. That’s another thing with conferences: they’re all over the world, which is cool, but in the end I feel like we’re sitting in our office all day long and we’re not connecting with the crowd in our community.</p>

        <p>So I thought, <i>‘why don’t I just start a breakfast gathering?’</i> In New York, there are so many things going on at night that you compete with a lot of other events. I thought, <i>‘yeah, let’s just throw it upside down and do something in the morning before work,’</i> and you go to work feeling inspired.</p>
        <p>Everybody laughed at me. In Switzerland, we get up early. Here they were all like, <i>‘you think New Yorkers are going to show up at eight-thirty in the morning?’</i> But I proved them wrong. Now we average 300 people at eight-thirty in the morning. Whenever my studiomate Cameron shows up I know I’ve picked a good speaker, because he really does not like it at eight-thirty in the morning! CreativeMornings makes it worth getting up early once a month!</p>
        <p>The beauty of CreativeMornings as it is right now is that it has this innocent feel — it’s so grassroots. Everyone involved is working on a volunteer basis and people feel that. There’s conferences I go to and you walk in and you smell that it’s just for the money. It makes me so sad because if you organise something like a conference, your mission has to be to get people together for the right reasons. It’s not wrong to make money, as long as you put a lot of love into it.</p>
￼
        <p class="question">One thing we haven’t talked about is Tattly.</p>
        <p class="answer">It was in spring of 2011 when my daughter came home with a birthday party goodie bag filled with hideous temporary tattoos. They were an insult to my Swiss aesthetics. Let’s put it that way.</p>
        <p>As I was helping her apply some of them, I thought, ‘you know what? I can change this.’ That night, I reached out to a few of my designer friends, asking them if they would be into designing a cool line of temporary tattoos for kids and grown-ups.</p>

		<!-- END a Pullquote figure //-->

        <p>The response was overwhelmingly positive. The very next day I had designs in my inbox. Tattly was up and running in two and a half months. We launched in July of 2011 with sixteen designs and now, a year later, we have around two hundred. What I’ve realised is that designers really love designing for skin. It’s a completely new canvas.</p>
        <p>The more I talked to other people that sell products, the more I realise how incredibly easy it is to sell temporary tattoos. It’s a small product, easy to ship, doesn’t take up much room, and is not expensive to produce.</p>
        <p>We are now a year in and Tattly is the most fun project I’ve ever worked on. I get to collaborate with illustrators and artists that I admire and I get to create a passive income stream for them. Plus, I have the most amazing team working for me. I am a very lucky woman. When I look at the Tattly contributor page I can’t help but smile. It’s a massively talented group of people.</p>

        <p>In some way, I see my Tattly contributor family as a mini community. And so is Studiomates and CreativeMornings. And maybe in some virtual sense my Swiss Miss readers.</p>
        <p class="question">A lot of your success seems to come from building those communities.
        <p class="answer">Yes! It’s crazy and it’s all because of the web. I consider myself extremely lucky that I have this loyal audience who follow me on my blog, because TeuxDeux wouldn’t have spread nearly as quickly — or at all — if I didn’t have an audience that trusted me to a certain extent. It’s the same with Tattly.</p>
        <p>I just want to add that I grew up in Switzerland — it’s really organised and rigid and on-time and it’s a little stiff to a certain extent, and that’s why I live in New York now. I had a very eccentric aunt called Hugi. She was the black sheep in the family: the creative, artsy, outgoing, crazy type who didn’t care what people thought of her. That’s very unusual for the Swiss. She would jump into a pool with clothes on even though you’re not allowed to; she would let us eat spaghetti with no knives and forks; she would paint walls; she was just outgoing and crazy. I firmly believe that without her I wouldn’t be where I am right now. I’m a firm believer that every person needs an eccentric aunt — of course, it can be a metaphor — in their life.</p>
