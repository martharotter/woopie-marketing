		<p class="question">I know you've had a history in advertising so we thought it'd be an interesting place to start to give a bit of context and if you could explain how Happy Cog came into being.</p>
		<p class="answer"><span class="person">K </span>I failed at several things first. I was a musician ­ I played with a post­punk, techno­surf band called <i>The Inside Surfers</i> that was popular in DC in the mid­80s and I had a studio and recorded music but I was a composer and really liked my music but I didn't know how to market it or schmooze or put myself forward. I did a couple of cool things, like I worked with Robert Goldstein, the guitar player of Urban Verbs who had a contract with a Warner Bros. label and we did some music for PBS. There is no equivalent for BBC but if we had a BBC, PBS would be it. They'd do documentaries about climate change and we'd do the electronic music for that, we did the music for a dance company.</p>
		<p><span class="person">D </span>I wasn't really making a living from that and I ended up in advertising. I went in thinking I was going to make short films and posters. I thought I would make really funny, artistic little movies and beautiful posters and somehow that would move the client's product and everybody would be happy. What I actually got was a printing education and what not to do and I got a good education in client services. I learned about meeting with clients, listening to them, being their partner, not having a pretentious attitude about what you do, not having an 'us­versus­them' attitude ­ because that doesn't work.
There was cliquishness in advertising and I thought if I ever had a career, I didn't want to be cliquish like that and I hope I'm not. I saw people taking credit for other people's work. There were lots of good creative directors, art directors, writers, who gave other people credit. I saw both things and I was like, "I like that ­ I like giving people credit, fostering other people's careers."</p>
		<p>By the time I became a web designer, I already had a mentor role ­ even though I was totally new at web design, so was everybody else ­because I'd already worked with younger people in advertising. I'd already worked with older people too, so I had the respect of the people who came before and I felt like I moved from junior status to mature status from switching from advertising to the web. The first thing that happened was I had an advertising client, the movie was 'Batman Forever' but it wasn't a Tim Burton movie, it was when another director actually came over, Joel Schumacher. He was a pretty interesting visual stylist too.</p>

		<p>A guy named Brian Platz and I came up with a list where everyone could send in what they were thinking about and we would curate and edit it. And, once a day, you’d get it. It was like a daily newspaper on web design, written by its users.</p>

		<!-- START a Pullquote figure //-->
		<figure class="fig-pullquote">
			<aside>
				<blockquote>
					<p>You definitely have to understand the user — that’s really important and ultimately who you’re designing for — but you have to understand the person who’s standing between you and the user, too.</p>
				</blockquote>
			</aside>
		</figure>
		<!-- END a Pullquote figure //-->
<p>By editing and curating we could give shape to the content and make sure there was good behaviour. If someone was deliberately trying to put someone else down, we wouldn’t have to publish that. There were plenty of other places to be a troll and that’s why we called it ‘A List Apart’. Eventually the website more or less took over.</p>

<p>At Happy Cog the client services work finances products like A List Apart, so we never need to involve investors. I always wanted to make products that I thought were cool, like Foursquare, because I love that stuff. I wish I could come up with things like that, but I don’t. Everything that I come up with is content-based and labour-intensive. Eric Meyer and I created An Event Apart, but it means that we work on it every day.</p>
		

		<p class="question">You’ve always been very generous in your support and praise of your colleagues, both in Happy Cog and in the wider industry.</p>
		<p class="answer">Promoting other people, mentoring other people, giving knowledge away — there’s a payback to it, but you don’t do it for that reason. There is karma and if you don’t promote and support the people who work for you, they’re going to hate you and leave. I worked in places where people would say, <q>‘Jeffrey Zeldman and his partner did this, it was a really great campaign,’</q> and I worked in other places that didn’t do that. I would leave those places as soon as I could.</p>
		<p class="question">At this stage were you designing, getting in with code or because you were more from an advertising agency background were you overseeing the production?</p>
		<p class="answer">My two colleagues did the graphics and I did the copy which was really important for the platform. We brainstormed and designed everything together but they executed the design. Everything was a place ­ so there was Gotham City which was where you were going and you went to the theatre to download these Quicktime files that took all day to download over a 14/4 modem. We made a city and we used the Netscape tile background so one building would be brick and there'd be all these bricks and then we would make a roof at the top and we knew that nobody had more than 600 pixels width on their computer so we were able to design an exact width. I mean, all the stuff that you can't really do.</p>
		<p class="question">No, you can't do it now.</p>
		<p class="answer">I left advertising and I became a web designer ­ that's all I wanted to do. I learned html and redid it because I wanted margins and the text was wall­to­wall and nobody thought that was ­ at the time, everyone thought that the web was supposed to be ugly. I used table cell padding or something and I was really proud of that. I had to sweet­talk the producer at Warner Bros. ­ I was like, "Can I have FTP access? I want to make a quick change."</p>
		<p>I started a personal site and I started teaching immediately ­ I wrote a book called 'Ask Doctor Web', a free, online book. It sucked, half the advice was wrong but you know, all the advice that people were getting at the time was kind of messed up. I wasn't trying to set myself up as an expert, I was just really enthusiastic about html ­ I thought, "everyone's going to be a writer now, everyone's going to be an artist, everyone's going to publish. html's so easy to learn, everyone's going to do design." I really saw this arts and crafts creative flowering happening in my head in 1995 ­ "everyone's going to learn this stuff."</p>
		<p class="question">It was democratised, wasn't it? It's the polar opposite to the advertising experiences you've had which are very corporate and stuffy.</p>
		<p class="answer">The ultimate advertising product wasn't corporate and stuffy but the meetings around it and the process ­ if they had an upper­middle manager, we had an upper­middle manager. If they had a guy who blew his nose into a Kleenex, we had a guy who blew his nose into a Kleenex.</p>
		<p>I worked at a place for a guy named Sal DeVito ­ we sold this amazing campaign to VH1. It was a brilliant campaign ­ it would have made my career. The client said, "I really love it, but could I just see a different font?" And Sal said, "no, this meeting is over." He got up and we left and that was it ­ and my career was over. Just because he wasn't willing to show them a different font. I knew that if I ever got to be a creative director, I was going to be in the more diplomatic, a different kind of macho.</p>
		<p class="question">There's a few things that have come out of that that we really wanted to talk about. One is the way you appear to nurture talent through the companies or the products that you've worked on. You see yourself as a mentor which I think would be worth touching on. Also, 'Ask Doctor Web,' was it a natural progression to go onto <a id="noterefJZ001"></a><a href="#noteJZ001" class="footnotelink">A List Apart <b>1</b></a></span> – to formalise that a bit?</p>
		<p class="answer">I encourage everyone to teach. Whenever I speak and people ask, "my career's kind of stuck..." I'm always telling them, "start a blog." It doesn't matter if five people read it at the moment ­ you'll figure out <a id="noterefJZ002"></a><a href="#noteJZ002" class="footnotelink">what you think. <b>2</b></a> I learn by reading other people too and I still learn every day by looking at you guys' websites and going, "Oh, wow. Why didn't I think of that? That's really smart."</p>
		<p>I think we have an obligation to do that and pass along this knowledge. If you went to a pastry shop, it would be a pity to at least not try a pastry and if you work in this medium that's democratic and worldwide and instantaneous and there's lots of other creative people older and younger than you from all walks of life, rich and poor, who all have ideas and are all contributing to it, it would be a pity not to share your ideas.</p>
		<p>'A List Apart' was a natural progression from 'Ask Doctor Web' to a mailing list. There was a really good mailing list called 'webdesign­L' that a guy named Steve Champion was running. He later became my friend on the Web Standards project. Steve was doing that and I really wanted to do one. There were some really popular lists in 1996 in New York, but I couldn't read them because there were a lot of egomaniacs on there that would dis each other. Those comment wars would sidetrack and derail the conversation that the mailing list was actually trying to foster.</p>
		<p>Me and a guy named Brian Platz came up with a list where everyone would send in their articles, send in what they were thinking about and we would curate and edit it and once a day, you'd get it. It was like a daily newspaper on web design, written by its users. It was kind of web 2.0 in a way, in the sense it was written by its users, it's community, but it wasn't happening live because by editing and curating we could a) give shape to the content and b) we could say, we could make sure there was good behaviour. If someone was deliberately trying to put someone else down, we wouldn't have to publish that. There were plenty of other places to be a troll and that's why we called it 'A List Apart' ­ it was that and it was named after 'A Band Apart' which is a guitar film.</p>
		<p>Eventually the website more or less took over. The mailing list dropped away ­ one reason was that it was probably inevitable that a website would be more important and then the other thing was we lost control of the mailing list for a while through no fault of our own. Basically, someone sold something and we accidentally got sold with it.</p>
		<p class="question">The domain and stuff?</p>
		<p class="answer">Yeah, so we lost it. There was a period where you had to go to alistapart.zeldman.com to see 'A List Apart'. At first, we just went to the community, I went to my friends ­ people I thought were doing interesting stuff on the web. There was a guy called Lance Arthur who did a site called glassdog.com that was amazing, Steve Champion, Dori Smith ­ and I reached out to these people ­ and Derek Powazek who had fray.com who was doing art direction, per article, on the web in 1996.</p>
		<p>'A List Apart' became this community and over the years, we've brought in a real editor ­ Erin Kissane, then Krista Stevens took over as editor and Mandy was an editor as well for a while. I mean, there's a lot of people that work on it ­ Erin Lynch, Tim Murtaugh. Jason's been the design director there now for years and you know, Brian Alvey did a CMS for it at one point.</p>
		<p>At Happy Cog the client services work paid the bills so that we could then do stuff like 'A List Apart'. I always wanted to make products that I thought were cool, like Foursquare, because I love that stuff. I wish I could come up with things like that, but I don't. Everything that I come up with is content­based and labour­intensive. Eric Meyer and I created An Event Apart but it means that we work on it everyday.</p>
		<p class="question">You've got a client services business, A List Apart, A Book Apart, your own speaking, you blog a lot more than most people do...how does it work?</p>
		<p class="answer">You have to be able to delegate, which is another good reason to promote people. I didn't do A List Apart to try and get famous ­ I didn't to the Web Standards project with my colleagues who co­founded it with me to try and get a name. It was all just we thought it had to be done, someone had to do it.</p>
		<p>The Web Standards project to me was an all star cast responding to an untenable, unsustainable web development situation. If we didn't get standards, then either one browser would win or you would be decoding for four browsers plus Flash ­ it just seemed crazy. There was a famous blogger who said, "the reason Zeldman and his friends are promoting standards, CSS, is so that you'll pay them a higher price to design for them." At the time, I was doing websites for $10,000 for a full, really serious website. I was like, "are you kidding?" I was doing work for free all the time. But 10 years later, he's right. Ten years later, Happy Cog is successful.</p>
		<p>You don't give stuff away with the idea that you're going to, but there's a little studio now that does the t­shirts that I always wear. A studio in Pittsburgh, <a href="http://www.unitedpixelworkers.com/">United Pixelworkers</a>. They're doing it for fun and for community but if it ends up bringing them clients five years from now, that's cool. Promoting other people, mentoring other people, giving stuff away, giving knowledge away ­ there's payback to it and you don't do it for that reason, but there is karma and as far as managing all of this stuff goes, you don't promote the people who work for you, they're going to hate you and leave.</p>
		<p>I worked in places where people would say, "Jeffrey Zeldman and his partner did this, it was a really great campaign" and I worked in other places that didn't do that. I would leave those places as soon as I could.</p>
		<p>From a self­interested point of view, I also don't micro­manage. If you've got someone like Jason Santa Maria working for you, you don't really need to breathe down his neck and tell him how to design a page ­ because he may be better than you. I think a lot of it for me, is just finding people who are better than me at everything that I do and delegating to them ­ whether it's the business side of things ­ so you have someone bringing it like Greg Hoy running the East Coast office of Happy Cog. He's better at that than me and I get better project managers, better designers, better coders and I just step back. 			<p>Although I miss all the hands­on work, I now have the freedom to create a book series or I now have the freedom to start some other business.</p>
		<p>I have the trust that, for example with A Book Apart, Mandy Brown is a really good editor and if I don't have time to look at the author's draft today, Mandy will and if I don't have time to give the author comments on the first draft, Mandy will and it'll be fine. With A List Apart, I try to read everything that's submitted and have comments early on but if I don't have time, Krista Stevens is a great editor, we've got Rose Weisburd who is a really great acquisitions editor and we've got these really smart technical people who've worked on the site over the years who review everything.</p>
		<p class="question">One of the things that has been really interesting in these interviews has been a lot of people have actually been moving away from client services and you're interesting because you're straddling both worlds. What do you enjoy about keeping your hands in both pies?</p>
		<p class="answer">We've always published a magazine and we've always done client work. Happy Cog started as just me and I used to hire people as I needed them. Now we have studios in Austin, Philadelphia and Europe.</p>
		<p>I don't on a day­to­day basis, have much to do with the client services anymore. I have a chairman role on client services. I feel like Walt Disney a little bit. If I see something that I don't like, I'll very gently say "why are we doing that?" Or "I don't understand" or "why does it look like that?" I try not to be unsupportive to the team, but mostly I don't have to because they're very talented people.</p>
		<p>Right now I'm more interested in content. I spend a lot of time on our book series, a lot of time picking people for An Event Apart, planning the playlist of human beings that goes on stage. We went through a period a couple of years ago where we'd put the same people on at every show so we'd have a roadshow and that was sort of like a play ­ "well, they played in Boston, now they're taking Chicago to..." Anyway, so we're mixing it up again so every show is different now ­ we're bringing people from all over. There's a million details on that. There's a million details on the books, there's a million details on the magazines.</p>
		<p>Then we have Cognition, the Happy Cog blog which is taking on a life on its own and thinking about films a little bit... there's a lot. There's only two things that keep me sane right now because I can't drink, I don't smoke anymore, I don't take drugs and I can't just eat cookies even though I'd like to. I work out and another thing I do, when I'm with my daughter I don't work. When I'm with my daughter, which is like, half the time I just have total down­time. I just focus on her and that's really good cause it gives my body a chance to detox from all the stress of days like today.</p>
		<p class="question">It's interesting because I have children too and I find I have to check myself quite early on and try and switch off when I'm with them. It's difficult, we're so connected with the phone, the laptop's etc. It's hard.</p>
		<p class="answer">It is. I'll pull out the iPhone cause I'll feel like, "I'm not really working if I'm checking email." And my daughter calls it "the hellphone": she's like, "pay attention to me and put away the hellphone".</p>
		<p class="question">I guess the last question on our list is what's coming up for yourself. It sounds to us that maybe it's focusing more on the content side of things and pushing A Book Apart?</p>
		<p class="answer">Yeah, our next five books, our next five issues of the magazine and a year worth of conferences. Every year we think about Europe and what we're going to do about that and then we've had people tell us, "don't you dare come to London ­ London is mine!" But it is ­ people do get territorial. I think if we go to Europe, we want to go some place where they don't have what others are offering ­ because I think there are some other good conferences where you can have a very similar educational experience to An Event Apart and we don't need to come in and push the event aside if someone's already doing a great job with the same kind of speakers and the same kind of material.</p>
		<p class="question">I think you pitch it well ­ "an event for people who make websites." I think events over here, speaking personally, have something of an identity crisis sometimes ­ but that's probably a whole other conversation.</p>
		<p class="answer">We've hung onto that and there's a guy named Jeff Croft who on Twitter is trying to draw me into this conversation. He'll go like, "I feel like Zeldman's really limiting himself with that phrase." I've even thought, "Is he right? Should we say, 'for people who design or create strategies for or experiences around apps, websites..." it's like "no ­ it is what it is." To me, it's like the Morton salt ­ but we have old brands where the brand's been around for a long time and maybe has a picture with I don't know, and old colonial with a monocle on it and it doesn't change. They might clean it up a little bit every 20 years but basically, that's what I feel that we have.</p>
		<p>What we're trying to say is that we're for the working designer­/developer ­ the person who goes to the designer who codes. The person that goes in there and they might not be the greatest designer in the world, they may not be able to compete in poster design but they're still a valid designer. They might not be the most amazing coder in the world, but they want to do things right, they want to use semantic markup, they know how to use jQuery, they understand CSS and they're making the world a better place.</p>
		<p>I was on O'Reilly's website yesterday and they're still using tables for layout, which just shocked me. I mean, I really respect O'Reilly ­ I think they have amazing, high­quality books one after another, they're really on top of all these topics. I'm sure there's a reason like a CMS limitation or "if it ain't broke, don't fix it" or something else or they use their own page, they send it directly through email and it's easier with a table ­ I don't know.
There's so much going on that's bacard on the web but there's so few of us. I mean, the people who are going to buy your book and the people who attend these shows or read these blogs are the ones who are sort of pushing the web forward ­ and there are a lot of people who don't know how to do that. I really love that we do that and for me, my focus now is making the content that helps people do that.</p>
