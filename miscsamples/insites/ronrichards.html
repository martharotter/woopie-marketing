		<p class="question">How did you get into the tech world?</p>
        <p class="answer">If I had to describe what my interests are, I’m into tech, but I’m also really into content, communities, and the combination of how tech can empower communities to create content. If there’s a theme throughout my professional career it’s that.</p>
        <p class="answer">In 1987 I got my first computer with a CD-ROM drive. I was always a computer nerd playing video games. Then the internet hit, and from then on I was just hooked.</p>
        <p class="answer">I went to Ithaca College and focused on TV, television, and radio. I thought, ‘<q>I’ll go make movies and be the next George Lucas.</q>’ Maybe two weeks in, I was in class and realised I didn’t want to be the guy behind the camera; rather I wanted to be the guy who told the guy behind the camera what to do. So I changed my concentration to media management. I never took a marketing class and the only programming classes I took were in high school.</p>
        <p class="answer">The internet boomed while I was in college. I had ethernet in my dorm, which was unheard of in the late nineties. Part of my college experience is that I didn’t drink. I was straight- edge for thirteen years, so while all my friends were out getting hammered, I was sitting in my dorm room. It was a choice; part of the hardcore punk scene. As I had nothing to do in my spare time I did two things: I taught myself HTML and JavaScript — I got a book in 1995 and taught myself how to code; and I started a magazine because I loved content.</p>
        <p class="answer">It was initially a thirty-two-page black and white newsprint called Muddle. I interviewed bands, wrote articles and reviews, and put all my time and energy into that throughout my four years of college. I taught myself how to write journalistically, how to do layout, how to do production, and how to get something printed. On the business side of things, I sold ads. By the time I graduated college, the circulation was around ￼15,000 and being sold in Tower Records. It became a business.</p>
		<p class="question">How often were you publishing?</p>
        <p class="answer">I think at our best we were quarterly. It was a lot of fun, I learned a lot, and it was profitable. I did that until 2002 or 2003 until it died down. By that time it was up to 20,000 to 25,000 circulation in all the bookstores, internationally distributed, and full colour.</p>
		<p class="question">Why did you stop it?</p>
        <p class="answer">Life. I ran it with a partner; we lived together during sophomore year of college. He was a year older than me and he graduated and moved to San Diego. From 1998 until 2002 I was in New York and he was in San Diego and we were doing it all through email. It got hard because it was one thing when you were in college and there’s nothing to do, but then I graduated and got a real job and started having a social life.</p>
		<p class="question">Was the website stuff you were doing just an advert for the site, or was it actually all on there?</p>
        <p class="answer">Back in the nineties, sites were just brochureware, so if you went to our website for the ’zine it had all the information about what the latest issue was, where you could order it, and information on back issues. There was no content, so it was basically just a couple of pages. It wasn’t until 2001 or 2002 when I built a site to have web-only content.</p>
        <p class="answer">In 1999 I had to get a job and I didn’t want to go to LA, but the internet boom was pretty cool. So on a lark I applied to a digital agency called Modem Media. I applied for a developer and designer job, despite not being very good at either role. I ended up being hired as an assistant project manager. I started that job two weeks after college and moved to Connecticut. Within four months they promoted me to an associate project manager. I was in the right place at the right time. At twenty-two I was managing the Delta Airlines’ website redesign.</p>
        <p class="answer">I then went to Starwood Hotels and Resorts, and they own the W, Westin, and Sheraton chains. I spent the first couple of years just getting their content management system running. After that I managed their marketing group, which was a team of about seven or eight project managers. When I started at Starwood we did $150 million in revenue on the websites, and when I left in 2007 we were doing $1.4 billion.</p>
		<p class="question">How did iFanboy start?</p>
        <p class="answer">In 2000 I lived by myself in a new town in Connecticut. The girl I was seeing at the time was living a long way away, so I wasn’t going out every night. My buddies I went to college with were all comic book fans, and when we graduated we all went our separate ways. We had an email list and every week when new comics came out, we’d email each other with two-line reviews of what we thought.</p>
        <p class="answer">We did that for six months. I went to two of my closest friends on the list and said, ‘<q>this email list is fun, but why don’t we just build a site? If we build a site then we have a place for our friends to come and talk about comics.</q>’ There wasn’t a website that filled the void of what I wanted out of a comic book website.</p>

        <p class="answer">The same reason I did the ’zine and Muddle was because I wanted to participate in the scene, but there was no magazine that I wanted to read, so I decided to make what I wanted to read. We came up with the name iFanboy. At the time the ‘e’ prefix was big — eMachines were selling cheap computers and e-this and e-that. The iPod hadn’t come out, and I don’t think the iMac had been out yet. This was 2001, so before all the Apple ‘i’ stuff.</p>
        <p class="answer">Fanboy is generally a derogatory name in terms of comics. A fanboy is someone who’s seen as obsessed with comics, but lacks some social skills. Our thought was that we would ￼reclaim the term, and we threw an ‘i’ in front of it because it’s on the internet: iFanboy. It was the worst name ever. If I could turn back time I would change it.</p>
        <p class="answer">I found a developer who was working for my dad doing web development and he built the site for us in Perl. Basically I was ripping off Slashdot; I was a big Slashdot fan. I thought, we’ll have stories and when stuff happens we’ll post it. I don’t know how I came up with this; I must have stolen it because I don’t have any real ideas! You could come to the site and create an account and choose a username. You had your own profile page where could edit the content, and you could change what your profile said about you, and connect to your friends on the site.</p>
		<p class="question">So you invented Facebook!</p>
        <p class="answer">Pretty much! Our friends went to the site, but nobody ever used it. From 2001 to 2005 if you went to iFanboy.com you would literally have to wonder if there was a .wav file playing the sound of crickets. I don’t know why we kept doing it, but I loved making content and talking about comics. I was doing the ’zine at the same time and ran an ad in the ’zine for iFanboy. Some random kid down in Florida, who bought my ’zine and was into comics, went to the website and registered an account. Every week for four years he would comment on our reviews. His username was ‘thedudabides’ from The Big Lebowski. There were a couple of times we were wondering why we were doing the site as no one was using it, and we thought, ‘<q>we can’t let The Dude down!</q>’ It became a motivator and we kept on doing it.</p>
        <p class="answer">We went to San Diego Comic-Con one year and two or three weeks before the conference we had a server meltdown. The whole Perl site was gone and the developer who did it disappeared. I panicked. I installed Movable Type, ported over the over the design, and relaunched the site as a blog, throwing away the entire social network thing.</p>
		<p class="question">When did it start being an attraction and why?</p>
        <p class="answer">Once again it goes back to me being bored. When I was twenty- two, and the whole Internet boom happened, I was in the wrong place at the wrong time. I said if that ever happens again I have to get to San Francisco, because that’s where it’s all happening.</p>
        <p class="answer">In 2004 and 2005 I started to see the industry pick back up again after the down time. Flickr and Digg came out, and social networking became a thing. I started to see the winds of change happening, so I was able to con my bosses at Starwood into putting me into a position where I was the new marketing technology guy.</p>
        <p class="answer">I started going to the Web 2.0 summit, eTech, and other conferences. I started to get into the whole Web 2.0 thing and new technology. Part of that was that podcasts emerged. I started to wrap my head around syndicated content, RSS, and how could I use it at Starwood. I used to watch TechTV, which was a TV network that was a cable station; David Prager, Kevin Rose, and a whole bunch of other people I’m friends with now were on it. It got bought and shut down and they all lost their jobs. That was in 2003 or 2004 and Kevin went on to do Digg, and Prager and Kevin went onto form Revision3.</p>
		<p class="question">How did you get involved with Diggnation?</p>
        <p class="answer">At the time I was living in the suburbs in Connecticut, doing a soul-sucking job, miserable because of all the corporate crap. When podcasts came out, I wanted to do a podcast. It seemed like a really simple idea; I thought I could talk about comics, since I had this site about them.</p>
        <p class="answer">I emailed the guys who worked on the comic site and suggested doing podcasts. We got on Skype and recorded the conversation, I edited it and then we put it out as a podcast for iFanboy. Our first episode was awful — sixteen minutes of, ‘<q>ums,</q>’ and, ‘<q>ers.</q>’ Turns out it was the best marketing I’ve ever done in my career! That Christmas people got iPods and flocked to iTunes, where they discovered podcasts. They typed in comics and our podcast came up, they went to the website, and traffic started to grow. I never intended it. It was never anything that we wanted or planned to do.</p>
        <p class="answer">We were doing iFanboy podcasts in 2006 and getting a lot of traction. We went to San Diego Comic-Con with a video camera, a mic, and a mic cube, which we stickered with our logo. On the first day we walked onto the DC Comics booth, their PR person saw the mic cube, and came over to talk to us. We’d spent five years trying to be legit as a comics news site. We were getting 50,000 page views a month, and when we went to San Diego the comic companies wouldn’t give us the time of day, but when we walked into that booth holding the mic cube, a PR person came running over to me instantly — they all thought we were a legit, real website. We cut this video of our trip to San Diego and published it on YouTube.</p>

        <p class="answer">I met the guys from Diggnation as I’m a fan of the show, and on the show said they wanted to go to Japan, asking anyone with hookups there to get in touch. I worked at a hotel company, so I reached out to Prager and said we’ll sponsor the episode and give you hotel rooms. So Westin sponsored the two episodes of Diggnation and we put them up in hotel rooms. That’s how I met Prager and Kevin, and that got me in with the Digg guys like Jay Adelson.</p>
        <p class="answer">Jay told me he was about to launch Revision3 with the guys from Diggnation, and that they were looking for content. He’d seen the video we made at San Diego and he asked if we would want to do a show about comics for Revision3. Imagine the people that you’re watching on TV now want you to join the club! I was really excited. Jay then invited me to the Revision3 launch party, so I bought a twenty-four-hour plane ticket, flew out with Conor, got a hotel room, went to the party, slept, and came back to New York. It was a whirlwind trip.</p>
        <p class="answer">At that party I happened to be standing in line for a drink and I was talking to the guy next to me, who was Scott Simpson and worked at Apple. At the time he ran the podcast section, so we just started chatting. We exchanged information, and he started putting us into the promotions on iTunes.</p>
        <p class="answer">What was 500 listeners became 2,000 overnight. All those people went to the website. In January 2007 we launched the iFanboy video show on Rev3, which was being distributed as a podcast in iTunes. My buddy Scott promoted it for us and the cycle just kept going.</p>
        <p class="answer">In my day job I was looking for new technology for Starwood to use, hanging out in San Francisco a lot. I knew about Digg and all the other cool startups that were going on there and I went to the first Future of Web Apps, where <a id="noterefRR001"></a><a href="#noteRR001" class="footnotelink">Ev <b>1</b></a> gave this talk about why Odeo was a failure. He gave a very honest talk about what went wrong and mentioned and that they had another project that they were working on called Twitter. So I checked it out, signed up, and told my bosses about Twitter, saying I thought it had a ton of potential. I suggested that we set up accounts for all of our brands, provide offers, and do customer service. I was literally laughed at in the meeting. The VP who laughed at me has since recanted and said, ‘<q>you were totally right: two years later we went and did everything you said.</q>’</p>

        <p class="answer">At the time I was told that I was too young and naïve; that I’d got in too deep in San Francisco and lost the ability to identify what was a viable business; that Twitter would never make money. They bet that it wouldn’t be around by the end of the summer. At that point I realised I was done there.</p>
        <p class="answer">I tried to find a job and then, out-of-the-blue in June of 2007, Jay called and told me that Rev3 needed someone to run the website and asked me if I wanted to move out to San Francisco. So I dropped everything in October, moved to San Francisco, and started working at Rev3. I ran product and then marketing, too. I essentially had two VP roles as a senior director.</p>

		<p class="question">What was it like working there?</p>
        <p class="answer">At Starwood where there were 800 people and I was one member of a team of sixty. There was politics, hierarchy, you needed to get approval, stuff like that. At Rev3 there were fifteen to twenty, where the attitude is, ‘<q>let’s just do it</q>’.</p>

		<p class="question">What’s the whole Diggnation experience like? We’ve all seen it from the outside looking in.</p>
        <p class="answer">I loved it. That was one of my favourite parts of the job because it goes back to my music days. When we first started doing those live Diggnations, I was part of the key crew that executed it. For all intents and purposes I was like a stage manager.</p>
        <p class="answer">What was great was that it was very similar to what I was doing with iFanboy and the music scene: it was a community. Everyone was there for the same reason. You always had someone to talk to at a live Diggnation show. We were all coming from the same place — that’s why the fans seem to love it.</p>
        <p class="answer">It’s the same thing with iFanboy. Now we throw parties at these conventions and they’re basically like meet-ups for our fans. We first did this in 2006. We posted that we were going to be at a bar on the website and six people showed up. This past New York Comic-Con, we threw a party on the Friday night of the convention at a bar, and we filled the bar so much that we had overflow in three surrounding bars. The party went until five in the morning.</p>
        <p class="answer">It’s basically like a circus: you put up a circus tent and you give something for people to rally around. Everyone wants to feel they’re a part of something and that’s what Revision3 does very well. They don’t talk at the audience: they talk with the audience.</p>
        <p class="answer">I co-host a show called All About Android for TWiT because I’m an Android nerd. We sit around and talk and do audio and video. We’ll talk about the news and then take an email from an audience member or we’ll play a voicemail or YouTube video from an audience member. The whole time we’re doing a show there’s a live chat room with 400 people talking and we’re reacting. It’s this participatory media that I think is fantastic.</p>

		<p class="question">You got in front of the camera in the end!</p>
        <p class="answer">I did. I never intended to get in front of the camera, or behind the microphone, or anything like that. I’m not very eloquent and I mumble, but something works.</p>

		<p class="question">So, back to the present. You sold iFanboy and became part of Graphicly — what’s next?</p>
        <p class="answer">Graphicly started out doing digital comics. iFanboy joined Graphicly and we’re trying to figure out how to bring comics into the 21st Century. It’s very similar to the problems the music and movie industries have had.</p>
        <p class="answer">It’s been fascinating to be at Graphicly and to be part of it. I used to say we’re in the first inning — to use a baseball metaphor — but we’re in the second inning now. It’s so early in the game. I’ve only been here for a year, but in no other job I’ve had have there been so many changes in such a short period of time.</p>

		<p class="question">What we love about your story is sheer bloody-mindedness, in a sense, during those early years. You got where you wanted to get.</p>
        <p class="answer">It’s a combination of things. I was a fan. If you look at both comics and technology, I was a comics fan and wanted to be involved. I can’t write or draw comics, so this is how I get to be involved. Now I’m very lucky to call some of my favourite writers and artists friends, and to be considered ‘somebody’ in the industry.</p>
        <p class="answer">As for technology, I taught myself everything. I watched the guys at TechTV and lusted to come to San Francisco. It was this Mecca I would get to and I figured out a way to make it happen, but I never planned it. I wasn’t determined; it was just that I didn’t say no. Opportunities came and I took them. But I might not be around tomorrow. You only live once. You might as well just try, and that’s what’s driven me.</p>

		<p class="question">Even though we work, live, and breathe technology, the old thing about getting out and meeting people pays dividends.</p>
        <p class="answer">I would go further and say it’s our new currency. The greatest value I have right now is my ability to shake somebody’s hand, follow up with an email, follow up on Twitter, and maintain that relationship. It’s a little more than acquaintance; a little less than a friend.</p>
        <p class="answer">You stay present, make sure people know what you do and what you’re capable of, and then you never know where that next opportunity going to come from. By following that dream and going to that party and meeting the dude at Apple, it’s all serendipity. Luck.</p>

		<p class="question">One final question: what happened to The Dude from Florida?</p>
        <p class="answer">He lives in Seattle and is happily married. He works for a company that analyses oil deposits in soil. Every year there’s a comic convention in Seattle and every year I go and have a drink with him.</p>
