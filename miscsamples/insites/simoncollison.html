		<p class="question"> With the web reaching maturity, what is the current state of our industry, as you see it, compared to when you started?</p>
        <p class="answer">In the beginning we were all finding our way. The web was a means to an end: you either had a website or you didn’t. Most of us didn’t go off and commission one. I had my own arts organisation at the time and needed a website, so I stumbled into it accidentally. I didn’t see it as an industry at the time.</p>
        <p class="answer">I reckon we’ve had an industry since web standards really took hold and we got behind that as a revolution, appreciating that we needed order amidst all the chaos. That gave us a framework, rules, and the ability to check our work against criteria.</p>
        <p class="answer">Fast-forward to now and I certainly see it as a mature industry. I don’t like to hear people describe the internet as ‘young’ or ‘immature’ because it’s been around for twenty years in some form or another. The last ten years in particular have been incredible in terms of the industry ‘growing up’.</p>

        <p class="answer">My first job was the end of 2002. I was finally employed as a web designer and I didn’t quite know what to do — there was no way of checking against anything; you had to just take things at face value. We didn’t necessarily realise that people were struggling to consume the information we put out, or that there were people with certain disabilities who were struggling to access everything we put on the web. We were very naïve, whether that came from our lack of training, or the fact that we were self-taught and were picking stuff up as we went along.</p>
        <p class="answer">My employers were very thoughtful people who were really starting to care about the industry. It was obvious to everybody that we needed standards. The web wasn’t incredibly well defined; we were thousands of explorers all heading in different directions, and at some point we needed to come together to define what we were doing. Having a set of principles as a means to move forward was a revelation for everyone.</p>
        <p class="answer">Although Jeffrey Zeldman wrote Designing With Web Standards in which he articulated this very well, I think of it as a community decision. There were people who were already keen and eager for this sense of order; people who were already bringing that to their projects to find a more responsible way of working.</p>
        <p class="question">Do you think the industry needs an official recognition of skills and training to move forward?</p>
        <p class="answer">I understand how it would help the perception of the web industry, but it seems a bit too ‘Big Brother’ for me — a little dictatorial. I can’t imagine a lot of seasoned designers would rush to be a part of it. I think it would give a false impression of who was worthy or not in our industry. But above all, governing seems, to me, an impossibility. How would you define the rules for an organisation of web designers?</p>
       <p class="question">How do you, as an individual, work out who’s good enough to work with when we don’t have those criteria, or socially-accepted markers such as a university degree?</p>
       <p class="answer">When I was first employed, I was taken on as a web designer and developer in mid-2002, when we didn’t really have defined standards and it was arguable as to whether I was the right person to employ. All I’d done at the time was build one website — it happened to be for my arts organisation and it’d become very popular. My potential employers asked what content management system I was using. I didn’t know what one was! But they saw something in me that they thought was valuable. I think because I had skills beyond those they would expect from a designer, they took a risk and saw that I could offer other value to the company. I love the fact that people took a chance on me, so when I started my own agency and started employing, we’d try to word job descriptions so people wouldn’t look at it and feel that they couldn’t do certain things. We tried to phrase it in a way that made people feel comfortable or confident that they could bring something to the table.</p>
       <p class="answer">In terms of assessing their ability, it’s tricky because a lot of it is on faith. I employed a few people whose work wasn’t great and not the best I saw during the interview process, but I could see risks taken, and I could see order. What would they be capable of in an agency environment, where they have deadlines and pressure and are surrounded by smart people? That was the risk I always wanted to take. There was only ever one time I had to get rid of somebody, but in almost all of the situations it paid off.</p>
       <p class="answer">I very rarely delve into somebody’s ‘about’ page or try to look for any qualifications. I’m not interested if somebody has a degree or not; I’m more interested in the personal appeal of somebody, perhaps from their personal website — how they write and what they write about. Are they interested in the industry? Are they curious? Are they enquiring into things, rather than accepting things at face value? Do they challenge the norm? The people who do are the people I find really interesting, and I think they’re the people of most value on the internet — they’re the ones who are going to accelerate the growth of the internet.</p>

        <p class="question">Did you feel you had enough time to curate a team, or did you get distracted by the business side?</p>
        <p class="answer">I used to get distracted by the business side of things, which is one of the reasons I left my own agency. In terms of putting a team together, getting that right seemed like the most funda- mental part of a growing agency. I wanted peoples’ roles to overlap; I never wanted a situation where somebody would go and talk to the client, hand that over, somebody else would design it, somebody else would then code it, and so on. I wanted developers to be able to question designers and vice versa. So at the time, it was really important to me and I got a lot of value out of it. For almost four years I ran a team as best as I could and the rewards were magnificent. What you can create as a team of people is obviously very significant and more than you can do as an individual. What you learn from other people in that situation is phenomenal, and it’s something I’ll never forget or regret, because that was an amazing three to four years.</p>
￼￼
        <p class="answer">￼Being on my own now, I’m still in situations where I need to work with other people and in some sense I’m evaluated by the people I collaborate with. So I’m still in that situation with the projects I’m working on at the moment. In fact I think things have worked out beautifully, because I get to collaborate with people almost all the time and that is a wonderful way of working.</p>
        <p class="answer">If you’re looking at a very ambitious project that takes on a certain kind of space on the internet, you need a team of people who can challenge each other and push things forward. There are many situations where I think I might produce something that I’m incredibly proud of, and some people can challenge and question that. To have that understanding is brilliant because it accelerates the growth of the product or application. Working with people who have different skills or experience is also really important. I’m a designer and I need to trust other people in a collaboration to bring their skills and strengths where necessary to the broader project. I need to work with — or be directed by — someone who has experience in that particular realm. For us all to understand each other’s strengths and challenge each other is a very, very rich thing, and we’re all learning a ton every day by working in that way.</p>
        <p class="answer">A good example is a project I’m working on at the moment: Fictive Kin. Cameron Koczon has already successfully created and sold a startup, so he understands that world a thousand times more than anyone else involved in the project. He understands VCs, investors, and the contractual side of it. Without that, we’d be lost. Instead, we have somebody heading up the project who can shape us.</p>
        <p class="answer">We also have Tyler Mincey, who was very involved in the release of the iPhone. Greg Wood is also working on the project with me. We’ve pushed forward many things on our first release or even the second release, and we’ve learned to understand and manage our beta audience through Cameron and Tyler to a point where we can get away with doing very little per release.</p>
        <p class="answer">￼We know about releasing apps in phases, but to actually see it from the inside — constructed in a very methodical and thoughtful way, and with a great understanding of the audience and the fans and the bands who are involved — we’re able to manage our expectations and theirs, and work in a wonderfully organised way that makes it very manageable. It’s amazing that to work on a project of this scale — and to realise that you know very little about how to manage the release of something — is quite a revelation, but also really rewarding on a day-by-day and week-by-week basis. It’s incredible how much I’m learning. One of the key principles of leaving Erskine Design was to learn new things and to take on new challenges; to be challenged and try to make work that was really meaningful — work that mattered to me, but that also mattered to a broad audience as well.</p>
       <p class="question">What can you tell us about this project you’re working on with Greg and Fictive Kin?</p>
       <p class="answer">Cameron funded it with just enough money so that we don’t have to take on too much client work. It was essentially a designer-led project, which really interested me. Rather than a development team building something and then designers coming along and making it pretty, the whole principle was that designers would lead it. From day one, Greg and I have had to wrestle with a million questions and thousands of problems, and we’ve designed the whole experience and considered every path in the narrative that people will encounter within the site. That has been a huge responsibility, but also incredibly rewarding. Over the course of seven or eight months, we’ve come from nothing to something: from an idea into something tangible and real that’s now being developed with us at the helm. And we have Cameron and Tyler who keep us on track, help us jettison bad ideas, focus on the good ideas, and restrain two eager, excited designers like me and Greg to a roadmap.</p>

       <p class="answer">I think it’s very different to any client project I’ve ever worked on, and obviously I’m considerably more passionate about this because it’s a project I care about greatly. We’re building something that could work on all sorts of levels, for fans and bands. The ideal is that it would be absolutely huge — the number one music resource on the web. But we’ve also designed it to work on a smaller scale. We’ve looked at the collaboration in such a way that if this project doesn’t work out, we would’ve learned how to work together as a loose team of explorers. We’ll have learned a lot about each other and when the next idea comes along, we’ll be able to work together in a similar way with a proof of concept behind us. So even if this particular project was to fail catastrophically, we’d still see an immense amount of value. The doing, the making, and the joy of actually creating something is as important as whether something is successful or not.</p>
       <p class="answer">I think of painters and people I used to study when I was younger, and they understood that seventy percent of what they created may well be thrown away, but it was worth that for the twenty or thirty percent that mattered. That’s the way I go about my work now. As long as I can pay my bills, I’m more than happy with that.</p>
       <p class="question">Is that a difficult concept to apply to the agency model?</p>
       <p class="answer">The agency model, in my experience, is driven much more by real-world issues than it is a desire to make a certain kind of work. The agency output in many cases — especially mid-level agencies like Erskine — is compromised in many ways by real- world cash flow. To get away from that idea and just enjoy making and doing affords you more opportunities to learn and develop as an individual. Some people disagree with me and think, ‘<q>you have to have goals.</q>’ I think one of the problems with goals is that we set them at a time for the person we are then, and not for the person we will end up being, which can cause disappointment. For a lot of people there exists this idea of going forward to something that you never actually reach, not noticing that what really matters is just the doing: the making and creating and enjoying what we do day-to-day.</p>

       <p class="answer">I know the secret of life, interestingly [laughs]: it’s pleasure in simple things. I’ve always had this since I started growing up; I realised why I was mostly happy. It’s because I took pleasure in the simplest, little things. Like a meal I’m going to have, or a new album by my favourite band, or I’m just having an ace day in my office: the music’s on, I’m doing some good work, and I just remind myself that, ‘<q>I couldn’t be happier right now.</q>’ It’s never looking at longer, bigger-term ￼￼things. My golden rule is that I’m just constantly surprised and delighted by why I’m happy because of all these little bits and pieces. I take great pleasure in little successes.</p>
       <p class="question">There must be agencies out there who are doing millions of pounds in turnover for huge corporations, but it feels that the good stuff is happening more in individual collaborations.</p>
       <p class="answer">We have a history in the last ten or twelve years of people working hard for two or three months on a problem, solving it, and then immediately releasing it for everyone to benefit from. Collectively, we grow through those individual lines of inquiry. The people who understand that you must transcend the mundanity of tools — and that the bigger design dialogue is more important — are the ones who have driven the web forward.</p>
       <p class="answer">I did a talk recently about how we’re all bricklayers: there have been bricklayers throughout history — people building and leaving anonymous traces of themselves throughout the world — and I think it’s very similar on the web. Every brick should count. People on the web don’t settle for what’s given to them; they’re prepared to enquire and challenge and discover and then share that with everybody else. That is what sets us apart. It’s like one big hive brain: every little bee is pushing collectively and that’s why we’ve got to where we are now. That’s why we’ve matured so quickly.</p>
       <p class="question">As an event organiser, you’ve entering a crowded space, but New Adventures has been tremendously successful. What did you think you had to offer that previously hadn’t been addressed?</p>
       <p class="answer">I was in an event in San Francisco where Greg Valinov did a brilliant workshop about editorial design and art direction. What was even better was the forty-five minute conversation that everyone had in the room afterwards. I thought, ‘I wish everybody in the world could hear this conversation.’ From that moment on I started thinking that I’d really like to push the design dialogue more. Specifically: intellectual, thoughtful processes for design. One night I had insomnia and it all seemed to fall into place in my head. I got up at five in the morning and thought, ‘<q>I can only do this if I’ve got some good speakers,</q>’ so I then emailed ten people who all said yes within ten hours. Based on the loose dates I’d given them, I booked a venue and everything started to fall into place.</p>

       <p class="answer">The idea was to create an event that didn’t pander to the audience in any way. In some ways it was a reaction to certain events that I feel have failed, or weren’t serving their audiences properly, and I wanted to do something where there would be a shared understanding. At New Adventures a very thoughtful, intelligent speaker takes to the stage and doesn’t have to frame what they’re going to talk about. They can assume that there would be 650 people in front of them ready for this discussion and that they could be challenged. The fact that it happens in January is interesting, as it’s the first event of the year and many of the subjects or issues raised have permeated other events, or talks and dialogue throughout the past year.</p>
       <p class="answer">Recently I saw a tweet in response to another conference that said, ‘<q>oh god, another conference. We don’t need this — we have too many already.</q>’ I disagree. I don’t think we have enough meaningful, genuine, thoughtful, challenging conferences. And it’s not as if everybody lives in the same city. We need conferences that serve the different communities and different people. The more of those, the better.</p>
       <p class="question">It feels that you and Greg are becoming a bit of a duo now. It’s a privilege to find someone with whom you can collaborate on many different things, who also happens to be a good friend as well.</p>
       <p class="answer">It is a privilege: it’s something to not take for granted. Greg was somebody we employed and took a chance on. He wasn’t a perfect fit and he showed immaturity across a number of things in 2007 when he was twenty-two, but there was enough we saw that got us excited. Dropping someone like him in at the deep end to see how he suddenly wrestles and spins the plates in that environment was tremendous. He’s a good example of when you put someone in that situation, they sink or swim. He swam and became — in my opinion — one of the most vital members of our team in terms of the ethos I had for Erskine. As he grew into a better designer than he ever realised he was, he became someone I wanted to work with as often as possible. After Erskine I knew there would be things we would collaborate on. I learn continuously from Greg. He’s refreshing because he’s not interested in recognition or in promoting himself.</p>
       <p class="answer">We’ve talked about doing something a bit more official, but we decided to remain individuals who happen to work together a lot, and that keeps our options open. I think it’s very important to have someone like that, as you can push each other and challenge each other. For me as an individual, it’s valuable because it sometimes feels a bit Lennon and McCartney. I think they wrote great songs because they always wanted to out-do the other one. It was a healthy competition and I think we have a bit of that going on. Well, I do. Greg doesn’t give a shit.</p>
