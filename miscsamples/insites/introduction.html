		<p>Hello and welcome to Insites: The Book. On the pages that follow, you’ll find twenty interviews with twenty-one of the most inspiring designers, developers, and businesspeople in the web and tech industries. By and large, we conducted each interview in person, starting in Brooklyn in October 2011 and culminating in Witney in April 2012, via San Francisco, London, Nottingham, and the occasional Skype call.</p>
		<p>When we came to edit everything and put the book together, one of the surprises we found was that many interviewees have since gone onto new things, whether that be through massive Silicon Valley acquisitions, or simply personal choices. The rather pleasant result is that each interview has become a snippet of a brief, fleeting moment in time, and an accurate portrayal of the speed at which our industry operates.</p>
		<p>The experience of conducting these interviews has been an incredible one. Some of the interviewees are dear friends; some our biggest heroes; many of them both. But each and every person we’ve spoken to has an amazing story to tell — a story we can all relate to, because even the biggest successes have the smallest, most humble of beginnings.</p>
		<p>We hope you enjoy our book and find yourself inspired by the stories our interviewees have been kind enough to share.</p>
