		<p class="question">What were your first experiences of designing for the web?</p>
        <p class="answer">I was always a huge fan of mobile phones. I got my first one around the time of the Nokia 3210 or 3310; they were the first ones that allowed you to send images inside text messages. They were black-and-white images, really simple, and just fifty by thirty pixels. You could forward them to other friends if someone sent you one, or you could buy them on certain websites.</p>
        <p class="answer">I was creating these images just for myself and I figured out how to send them from my computer to my phone, and then to my friends. It was mostly copying logos from well-known skate brands. I found a guy who had a website with a list of a lot of different images — you could click on one, have it sent to your mobile phone, and the payment would happen via text message.</p>
        <p class="answer">I contacted him and told him that I had a bunch of text images that he could put on his site and sell if he wanted. I didn’t ask for any money. He gave me access to the website and taught me how change the HTML and upload my artwork. My first website was actually on Geocities!</p>
        <p class="answer">Around this time one of my friends told me to look at this thing called CSS: he told me it was the future! I bought a book on it — I think it might have been Zeldman’s first book — read through it, and started experimenting. At first it was really difficult and I thought, ‘<q>why the hell would anyone want to use this? It’s so complicated! It’s like computer programming code!</q>’ Little did I know.</p>
        <p class="answer">Step by step, I started writing my own code and the more you do it, the faster you get, and after a while you don’t have to look at the book anymore.</p>
		<p class="question">How did you start getting client work?</p>
        <p class="answer">Around 2000 I was attending college by day and creating my web sites by night. My wife — who back then was my girlfriend — had a friend who needed a website, so they contacted me and it went on from there. At that point I’d never worked for a client in my life. I actually ended up quitting college as I wanted to start freelancing. My parents got angry and told me that I needed a real job before I went to work on my own.</p>
        <p class="answer">So that’s what I did: I went to work for this small development company. It was fun in the beginning, but in the end the job wasn’t really challenging me. As well as the day job, I was working for my own clients and they would pay me in laptops and cell phones and books because I wasn’t a legal business entity yet.</p>
		<p class="question">So you have to be a legal business entity in Belgium to actually earn money?</p>
        <p class="answer">Yes. I got paid in laptops and books that I never read. My first Apple computer was a seventeen-inch MacBook Pro, which was kind of awesome. I got a thirty-inch Apple Cinema Display and a bunch of other stuff. It was like Christmas six times a year.</p>

        <p class="answer">I worked for that company for about eighteen months and I wanted a raise. I knew that the work I was doing was really good — it was high-quality HTML and CSS and super easy for the developers to implement — but they wouldn’t give me a raise. Around the time I went to live with my girlfriend, I had to tell my parents that I was also going freelance. Two big risks at once! That’s when I started Made By Elephant.</p>
        <p class="answer">By this point I had a large number of clients and people who knew me, so when I started freelancing it was pretty easy to fill my schedule thanks to word-of-mouth. I emailed all of my previous unofficial clients to say I was going freelance and if they knew anyone who needed a website to just let me know.</p>
        <p class="answer">One or two of them were really supportive and got me more work than I could handle! The first couple of months being freelance were really just a lot of fun. I was doing loads of work and not caring about doing paperwork because I had no idea how that stuff worked.</p>
        <p class="answer">I worked from home for three months but after that ended up working out of the office of a company I did some work for. Even after the project had finished I kept going in. The funny thing is we never talked about it! They were just like, ‘<q>okay, we’re not paying him anymore but he’s still here every day.</q>’ They moved a couple of times and I just moved with them! Even though they were developers, they gave me some awesome feedback and I was able to give them feedback on the stuff they were working on. It was perfect and just what I needed.</p>
		<p class="question">Was it around this time that you did the <a id="noterefTVD001"></a><a href="#noteTVD001" class="footnotelink">Atebits <b>1</b></a> site?</p>
        <p class="answer">Yes, I think by this point I had done the Atebits and <a id="noterefTVD002"></a><a href="#noteTVD002" class="footnotelink">24 Ways <b>2</b></a> sites. The branding for Made By Elephant, 24 Ways, and Atebits put me out there and people started to take notice of me.</p>

		<p class="question">How did you get to work on the 24 Ways site?</p>
        <p class="answer">For both 24 Ways and Atebits, I contacted them. With 24 Ways I contacted Drew and said, ‘<q>hey, I love 24 Ways. I’ve learned so much from it. It’s incredible. I feel so guilty reading the site because the content is so incredible and I want to do something in return.</q>’ So I asked him if it was okay for me to redesign the site. He said I could, but I had a month to complete it. So I told him, ‘<q>sure, I can do that!</q>’ [laughs]</p>
        <p class="answer">When it launched people went crazy about it. I was super proud. I had no idea it was going to be that big and I’m really grateful that Drew gave me the opportunity to design the site and had me write an article for it.</p>
		<p class="question">So rather than waiting for that dream job to come, you actually went out there and got it!</p>
        <p class="answer">Well, it’s okay if you do it and you still have a day job, or if you’re going to school, but if you’re freelance and you need to make money for yourself and your girlfriend, it’s the stupidest thing you can do. I’m not a fan of the approach and I’ll never tell anyone to do it, except of course when they have a decent job by day, or they live with their parents. For me it was just pure, dumb luck.</p>
		<p class="question">Did you collaborate with other people at all or have you always been self-sufficient in your client work?</p>
        <p class="answer">Back then I loved working on my own. Most of my clients had their own developers, or it was just a small project like a blog — I would design it, slice it, and maybe put a CMS underneath it. But every time I was working with clients’ developers or the developers themselves, I tried to go to their office every day. So I wasn’t working on my own — I was working together with them.</p>
		<p class="question">Did you change the amount you charged over time?</p>
        <p class="answer">I’m afraid the business guy inside me never evolved at all. I think by the time I went to work for Gowalla it was pretty much the same I was charging from when I started out. I had no idea what my services were worth. I often wouldn’t charge for small projects. Again, I should have starved from not having anything to eat, but I didn’t and I was lucky enough to have some good clients.</p>
        <p class="answer">Even when I did Atebits, at first I wanted to do it for free and they insisted on paying me. I wrote them an invoice and they sent it back and said, ‘<q>we don’t want it. It’s too little. Add more money.</q>’ So I added ten percent. I had no idea what a decent web professional costs. By the end I had kind of figured it out, but it didn’t matter because I was going to work for Gowalla.</p>
		<p class="question">It was quite a shock when you announced that you were going to work for someone!</p>
        <p class="answer">The reason I contacted Josh Williams was that I was sick of handling clients. What I love doing is design and making sites that are nice to use. I had some clients who wouldn’t pay on time or they weren’t happy with my work, even though I knew that what I was doing for them was high-quality that they would have paid double for if they went somewhere else. So in the mood of ‘fuck it all’ I saw that Gowalla were looking for a designer.</p>

        <p class="answer">I sent Josh an email in October 2009. I told them I was looking for a full-time job. I even put the reason in it: ‘<q>financial security, less client-related stress, working in a team, and the experience of living in the US.</q>’ It was a lifelong dream of mine to live and work in the US for at least a couple of years. At this point I was living with my girlfriend and we didn’t have any big responsibilities, so it was like a ‘now or never’ situation.</p>
        <p class="answer">Josh replied: '<q>I like your work. I’d like to chat a bit more. Looking to fill a position in Austin.</q>’ He agreed on flying me over to Austin for two weeks as a trial. They would pay me as a freelancer and I would work in their office for two weeks.</p>
		<p class="question">What kind of work were you asked to do during your trial?</p>
        <p class="answer">I was a web designer back then and I’d never done any native iOS stuff. During the two weeks of the trial I redesigned their home page and some other web stuff. The trial went great, then they flew Gwen over for a week. She loved Austin and we decided to accept their offer.</p>
        <p class="answer">We started the whole visa process, which I think took eleven months and three weeks. I didn’t have work experience because I was a freelancer and I didn’t have any diplomas from school because I quit twice. Almost a year after we applied for the visa I got a call that it had been approved. I was excited, but I was shitting myself at the same time. Keegan Jones helped us look for an apartment while we were still in Belgium and we signed for an apartment we’d never seen. Four months later we moved to the US, just the two of us.</p>
        <p class="answer">Prior to moving to the US I was freelancing for Gowalla for over a year. During that time Keegan and I were the only web designers at Gowalla and we naturally evolved into our own spaces; Keegan did all the web stuff and I slowly started doing the mobile clients. By the time I moved over I had about nine months of experience doing mobile design. I couldn’t imagine doing anything else now. If I had to make a business card, it wouldn’t say ‘web designer’, it would say ‘interface designer’.</p>
        <p class="answer">About nine months after we moved to the US, Facebook bought Gowalla and I saw it as being time for me to move onto the next challenge.</p>
        <p class="answer">The first thing I did — because I loved and wanted to do mobile design — was to take out my iPhone, go through all the apps and ask myself which apps I used on a daily basis, which apps I felt really passionate about, and which apps I thought I could improve. So I contacted Kevin Systrom from Instagram. We exchanged phone calls around the time my wife was ready to go into labour, so I couldn’t fly to San Francisco to meet him. In the end I started working for Instagram a week after our daughter was born. I’d never even met anyone in the team!</p>
        <p class="answer">We started slowly updating the iPhone app, then the first thing we did was re-skin some elements like the header, the nav bar, and the tab bar; and three months after that we released the Android app. A week after we released it, Facebook bought Instagram, and that was last week!</p>
		<p class="question">Was that a shock to the team?</p>
        <p class="answer">We kind of knew that a lot of companies were interested in buying Instagram because of its growth and because of its small team. We were pleasantly surprised when Kevin told us the company had sold to Facebook. We knew an hour before the rest of the world found out because the deal went down so fast.</p>
		<p class="question">It was a huge deal. Do you think things will change?</p>
        <p class="answer">The reason they paid the amount of money they did is to keep the magic of Instagram. They’re not going to tear us apart. They’ve done a lot of talent acquisitions in the past, but this is completely different. It’s the first time they’ve done something like this where they buy a company and just let it run as if nothing had ever happened.</p>
		<p class="question">As you look back on your progression so far is there anything you miss from your old life?</p>
        <p class="answer">My motto is: ‘<q>if you have any fear or regrets, there’s something wrong with the way you’re living your life.</q>’ So I don’t regret anything, and if I do, it’s my own fault and I can fix it myself.</p>
        <p class="answer">I’m happy with the way my life has run over the last couple of years. I feel happy looking back at where I was and where I am right now, the way I’ve grown and the way I’ve become a more mature designer. Not a more mature person, just designer. I’m still the Tim Van Damme that <a id="noterefTVD003"></a><a href="#noteTVD003" class="footnotelink">brought beer to Future of Web Design and gave it to you, Elliot, even though we’d never spoken face-to-face! <b>3</b></a></p>
        <p class="answer">Every single event over the past couple of years has brought me to where I am right now. So I don’t regret negative events, because I’m here and I couldn’t be more happy with how my life is right now. I live in the US, I make a decent living, I have a wife and daughter whom I love deeply and they love me, and there’s nothing to complain about.</p>
        <p class="answer">I know that there hasn’t been a dull moment over the past year and there won’t be over the next couple of years. I think I’m still too young to settle down, have a well-paid job somewhere as a creative director or something, and just stop evolving. I want to keep growing. The day I stop growing is the day I know something is wrong.</p>
