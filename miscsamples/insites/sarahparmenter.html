		<p class="question">When did you first start coding?</p>
        <p class="answer">I started learning coding when I was fourteen and still at school, when everyone was still on GeoCities. I hacked a friend’s site because I wanted to change all her pictures to transvestites. It was easier to learn HTML than to learn the clunky, GeoCities interface. That was basically how I started writing HTML.</p>
		<p class="question">What kit and computer were you using then?</p>
        <p class="answer">Dreamweaver and an old Dell PC. It was when the internet cost you a penny to be on as well. I learned coding from there. Then my mum’s best friend’s brother came over and he already had a successful agency in Australia. He was staying at ours, so he taught me various things about coding that I’d get stuck with. He was the sort of person who was always there for questions, even when he was back in Australia. I look back and think, ‘<q>why did I try and pursue that?</q>’ Because at the time I was doing my GCSEs! I didn’t need to do it at all, but still kept persevering with it and then went straight from school into acting.</p>
        <p class="answer">GCSEs, acting, and HTML. All happening at the same time.</p>

		<p class="question">Were you pursuing acting as the main thing?</p>
        <p class="answer">I went to college to do acting, but on the first day they put me on the wrong course. It was performing arts, but it just lasted all day and I thought, ‘<q>oh, maybe tomorrow I get to do English,</q>’ because I was doing A-level English and A-level Performing Arts. It turned out they’d put me on a B-tech Performing Arts and then wouldn’t change it.</p>
        <p class="answer">I ended up leaving after three weeks, going into acting and then kept doing the HTML thing on the side, learning Dreamweaver. It was a time where everything was table-based, so Dreamweaver was fantastic for that. When you think about it, it’s just like, ‘<q>drag, drop, brilliant.</q>’ So I kept learning that side of things and then went for a couple of jobs in acting, didn’t get them, and decided that I wasn’t really a strong enough personality to pursue that as a career.</p>
		<p class="question">Had you been earning money from any web stuff at this point?</p>
        <p class="answer">Yes, I had. I’d been working at a casting agency as well, doing their website updates, which is how I ended up with an agent without having to really go through their correct channels. I earned more money out of doing their website than actually doing their casting. I kind of decided pretty much overnight that I would then go straight into the web industry. I was nineteen.</p>
		<p class="question">Coding is one side, but did you have an artistic flair at school?</p>
        <p class="answer">I’d always been artistic. My mum and dad said as long as I had a box of crayons and some paper, I was happy. I used to go through so much paper that dad used to have to buy lining paper — wallpaper. Rows and rows of houses with smoke is all I seem to remember drawing. I was creative in school — I was always happiest when I was in art — but we did more fine art, because our school was really finicky about not using computers. They only had the old BBC computers so there was no opportunity to use Photoshop or anything at my school. It was all paper-based.</p>

        <p class="answer">I was lucky that my dad had an Atari, as he always kept up with having a computer in the house. I was much more on the coding side of things than design when I was younger, which is weird, because I’ve always thought of the two as very separate. I think it’s because my art teacher at school used to say to me that I would never make a living out of creating computer-based art. I never really thought of the two as being the same thing until much later on.</p>
		<p class="question">Once you started to properly get into it, was it natural for you to form your own business, rather than try and go to existing companies? Did you try and go to agencies or work in-house?</p>
        <p class="answer">No, I never did because I think I always presumed that I’d need a certain amount of skill level to do that and I wasn’t formally trained — I was self-taught. Because I’d not long come out of formal education and constantly heard, ‘<q>qualifications, qualifications — they’re the most important things,</q>’ I thought I needed qualifications in order to go to an agency. So it never really even crossed my mind to go and work for someone else.</p>
		<p class="question">What was your first paid web design job?</p>
        <p class="answer">It was for a recruitment company in Cambridge doing their logo design and a one-page website. I used to advertise on eBay with the business listings that used to cost about twenty-five pence a go. You’d have a listing that would say, ‘<q>I’ll do your logo and a one-page website for 150 quid,</q>’ which obviously seems ridiculous now.</p>
        <p class="answer">But it was a good way to grow a business at the beginning because it gave you instant clients, although of course we don’t advocate doing cheap work in order to gain stuff now. I used to get about five a week and sometimes I’d list the logos separately from the website design, so I’d do a logo for fifty quid.</p>
		<p class="question">When you started You Know Who, was that from your bedroom?</p>
        <p class="answer">Yes, it was from mum and dad’s.</p>

		<p class="question">The ambition was obviously there to make it a full-time job and your sole source of income. Would you say you had a great first year?</p>
        <p class="answer">No, because to begin with I was working hard, but not working smart. I would be doing logo designs for fifty quid and it would take me a week to get that client off my books. Although my family’s always had businesses, I was pretty much on my own because they had no knowledge of the web. If I was able to go out with some spending money to a nightclub and have enough money for a taxi, I was quite happy.</p>

		<p class="question">How did it ramp up? Were you taking active steps to find a wider client base?</p>
        <p class="answer">Yes, 100 percent. I was always really serious about it; I never looked at it as if I was playing at starting a business. By 2004, I’d outgrown the bedroom and I’d hired an office about fifteen minutes away. That was the first big step in taking on rent and overheads, which used to be about £800 a month. I remember ￼writing a cheque for the first three months’ rent in advance at the letting office and feeling sick. So yeah, I went into an office from then on and I had a girl come in and work with me. We actually entered into a partnership at that point, with her mainly looking after print work.</p>
        <p class="answer">But I realised quite quickly that that print side was becoming smaller and the web side much larger. She wanted to go travelling, so we dissolved the partnership and I ended up back on my own.</p>

		<p class="question">Did you have a process for attracting bigger or different clients? For a long time, you were doing a lot of work for local people.</p>
        <p class="answer">Loads of local people: it was the smaller businesses that resided in the streets nearby. Then somehow it started swaying to mainly US clients and I don’t know how that happened or why. I still had the office, but no-one was visiting and I wouldn’t have let anyone come up anyway because it got horribly redecorated and wasn’t the sort of environment that I wanted people to see. It seemed like a waste of time and I decided to move the whole thing home again.</p>
        <p class="answer">I think the swing happened when I joined Twitter, in 2006. I started to get different sorts of clients just from being an early adopter of Twitter and being able to easily talk to people.</p>

		<p class="question">Were you talking about web stuff on Twitter?</p>
        <p class="answer">Yes, and I had a blog from 2001. I just used to write about every- thing that had happened or business lessons that I’d learnt along the way, things that went horribly wrong, and so on. I think because I was still young at the time, I felt like I had an excuse.</p>
        <p class="answer">I made mistakes with my clients. I think I was too nice to them! I remember I was going to Spain and I was leaving for the airport at 7pm, and the client had me in the office with the door shut, demanding that I finish the work, and he was there at 5pm. This was a client that I considered a friend, and that was the point when I realised I needed to toughen up and say no.</p>
￼￼￼
		<p class="question">When did you feel you reached a position where you were more in control of the work you were able or willing to accept?</p>
        <p class="answer">Realistically around 2008, which seems like a long journey when I look back on it but that’s when I’d got better at hearing the alarm bells that would go off when you’d read an email.</p>

		<p class="question">How did you get into designing interfaces specifically for Apple products?</p>
        <p class="answer">One of my friends got the first iPhone and I remember looking at it and thinking, ‘<q>I don’t get how, but I want to design for that platform.</q>’ It happened to coincide with a client who had a Mac app and wanted to release an iPhone version, and they asked me if I’d be up for designing it. I remember being quite honest and saying, ‘<q>I’ll give it a go, but I’ve not done it before.</q>’</p>
        <p class="answer">I got some praise directly from Apple about the UI design, and although I wasn’t allowed to talk about it, it was just the incentive that I needed to keep going with it.</p>
		<p class="question">We know you’ve done a lot of iOS work, but there’s actually not that much in your portfolio. How do you spread the word about doing that sort of work?</p>
        <p class="answer">Yeah, most of it is under an NDA, sadly. I think in all honesty, I was one of the first people to change their website to show a really large iPhone with an interface on it. I made the conscious decision to showcase the iPhone stuff more than the web stuff from very early on and that small change really altered the type of work that was coming in through the enquiry form.</p>

        <p class="answer">I didn’t realise the true value of that work because I wasn’t seeing it as any different to Photoshop for the web. I also felt like I was almost charging clients for my learning curve, so I wasn’t really charging a premium, because I wasn’t really comfortable with it myself. I think that shifted when I was first asked to do a conference talk about iOS stuff.</p>
		<p class="question">Was that your first big gig, or had you eased yourself into it with some smaller ones?</p>
        <p class="answer">I’d done a smaller one. Coming from an acting background it felt easy to get up and talk in front of other people. It seemed like something that would be fun, like the colliding of two worlds. My first speaking gig was with Elliot, actually, in Bristol. Me, Elliot, Jon Hicks, and Dan Donald.</p>
		<p class="question">Going full-circle to your ten-year anniversary in the industry, you’ve talked before about the possibility of moving away from the one-person model to go down the road of potentially employing people within your company. What was the thought process behind that and what’s making you think that now might be a good time to look at that option?</p>
        <p class="answer">Basically just realising that standards are slipping with me on my own, because I’m trying to take on too much. I’ve realised that there have been a couple of times where I’ve not been happy and I’ve been annoyed with myself because the clients came back to me and said, ‘<q>I sent you an email three days ago — have you got an answer for me yet?</q>’ That constant feeling of never quite catching up; being able to work twenty-four hours and day and still not really chip away at what’s coming through the door. It’s a great problem to have, but when you’ve got no-one else to share that burden, it can be tough.</p>
        <p class="answer">I’ve just started thinking that my skills lie in design and a certain amount of UX stuff. Really, someone else is super passionate about project management and they’re going to be really efficient at doing that side of things. I don’t need to be doing that.</p>
		<p class="question">We’ve talked to a lot of people who work for themselves and a common theme is the fear of letting go; being able to delegate. Is that something that worries you?</p>
        <p class="answer">Hugely! But I’ve realised in the last year or so that if you teach someone something, then eventually they’ll do it the right way. You’ve got to get over that hurdle of, ‘<q>oh, it’s quicker for me to just do it myself,</q>’ and I think I’m at the stage where I’m quite happy to get over that now.</p>
        <p class="answer">The type of people I end up employing is going to be really important: not people who are going to be like, ‘<q>what’s this, what’s that?</q>’ My goal is to employ people who have a bit more initiative and good communication skills.</p>
        <p class="answer">Eventually, I’d probably be happy being almost an art director or focusing purely on UI design. I’ve realised my stuff suffers when my designs go to an outside developer. I’d rather be able to deal with it in-house and have the end-product turn out better.</p>
        <p class="answer">These days, I feel ready to take a few risks. If you can’t do it when you’re twenty-eight, when can you do it?</p>
		<p class="question">So if fourteen-year-old old Sarah Parmenter came to you for advice, what would you say with the wisdom of an additional fourteen years?</p>
        <p class="answer">I wish I’d been a bit more fearless in everything that I did. I don’t know why I was being over-cautious about things because I really didn’t have anything to lose.</p>
        <p class="answer">I think early on, if I’d hired the right kind of people rather than trying to battle with getting more skills myself and wearing more hats, it would have grown quicker. I took on too much. It’s like I thought that working until 3am in the morning was some sort of honour badge. You think you’re doing the right thing by doing that, but you never question the money in your account not reflecting the number of hours you’re working. Yeah, I’d change that.</p>
