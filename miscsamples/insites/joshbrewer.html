		<p class="question">Why don’t we start by talking about your role at Twitter and your journey up to this point?</p>
        <p class="answer">I’m the Principal Designer at Twitter. I joined the company almost two years ago after talking with Doug Bowman quite a bit. He, Kyle Sollenberger (from CoTweet), and I would have breakfast once a month. We were all married, had kids around the same age, and were creative directors at our respective startups. For me, I’d only been in the city for less than a year, so it was great to have two other guys I could actually talk to on many levels.</p>
        <p class="answer">And then one day Doug was like, ‘<q>you should come by for lunch.</q>’ I’ve always looked up to Doug — he’s always been a role model — so the chance of working with him was very appealing. The other thing was that I’d been using Twitter since ’06 and just flat-out loved the product. So I guess I really joined so that I could work with Doug and try and make an impact on a product that I (and many others) loved.</p>
		<p class="question">Were you one of the founders of the startup you were at?</p>
        <p class="answer">No, I wasn’t. I was one of the first few employees and the first designer. I spent two-and-a-half years there helping design and build out the product. At Socialcast we did activity streams for businesses, so I had a deep knowledge of activity stream behaviour and interaction patterns. I feel very fortunate to have worked on that product with that team. Tim (the founder) gave me a lot of freedom and expected a lot of me at the same time. It was an very collaborative environment and I definitely learned a ton in the process.</p>
        <p class="answer">I think my background and familiarity with designing activity streams was one of the things that made it easy for me to click with Doug — it felt like we spoke the same language. After a time working on the main product itself, I started asking, ‘<q>what do you need? What can we do to get things tighter?</q>’ Somewhere in the middle of last year, both Andrei Herasimchuk and I became design leads and took over the management side of the team, which freed Doug up to be able to focus 100% on the product.</p>

		<p class="question">How do you find that? Obviously that’s taken you one step away from the reason that you came here.</p>
        <p class="answer">I don’t actually think it’s taken me away from the reasons I came here — I’m still working closely with Doug and focusing on the product — but yes, it is definitely a different incarnation at this point. The interesting thing is that I recently became principal designer. We’ve set up a structure where, as a design lead, you begin leading a project and managing a few people. From there you can continue up the ladder, which can eventually lead to a position as a director. Or you can take the other route and move into a principal role, which is more contributor, less management — you’re still responsible for projects and you’re still responsible for leading design work.</p>
		<p class="question">It’s interesting that companies widely referred to as ‘startups’ are full of historical structures.</p>
        <p class="answer">Well, for quite a long time our team had a very flat structure, but at a point that just doesn’t scale. We got to the point where, in order for the team to really move as a cohesive whole, we needed a bit more structure, for accountability and for simply managing the multitude of projects going on at any one time. We needed a system or a process that would help us move faster and yet produce a more consistent design. I know that Doug, Andrei, and I all wanted to push and see if we could get to the point where Twitter’s design has a consistent voice, as if one person designed the whole thing. And in order to do that we needed a little bit of process and structure.</p>
		<p class="question">Is there a way to loosely describe that process?</p>
        <p class="answer">To be totally honest, with how we worked during the redesign, I don’t expect us to work in that fashion in the next year. It was an intense sprint — a five-month sprint! We started with a mobile- first approach and then we quickly realised that we had to figure out how these patterns would work on the web and on Andriod and our mobile web client. A lot of our rules were based on taking high-level concepts, getting to a place where we were okay with where the design was heading, and then giving the designers enough guidance, to say, ‘<q>you’ve got three days to design this.</q>’</p>
        <p class="answer">We started all of this by working in a room for a few weeks. There was a lot to do and a lot of pressure but I think it was good for us. It forced us to make hard decisions and to push ourselves to define a framework that we could work from for the foreseeable future.</p>
		<p class="question">Are you happy with what you achieved?</p>
        <p class="answer">Probably not 100 percent. I don’t think people are ever really, genuinely happy. If I have to be honest, I always find things in my own work — in my decisions — that can be improved. I think I’d be afraid if I ever feel like, ‘<q>oh my god, this is perfect.</q>’ Nothing is ever perfect.</p>
		<p class="question">How do you encourage highly talented, but more junior team members? Were they questioning? Was that encouraged?</p>
        <p class="answer">Absolutely. There were things that different people — including people that weren’t on the design team — would see in these things. They’d ask really good questions and we were like, ‘<q>oh, we hadn’t thought of that.</q>’ And that’s one of the things we really encourage: we should all be questioning in a healthy, constructive way. There’s a lot of peer feedback. Our work overlaps and touches others’, so we have to be talking.</p>
		<p class="question">With so many people working on design and engineering, how do you — as a design lead — establish the patterns? And how do you communicate that to the different teams so that there’s a similar experience across the various platforms?</p>
        <p class="answer">There were a number of ways that worked. In the really intense first sprint, one of the best things that ever came out of it was that most of us were sitting in a room together, and we nailed down a lot of things because of that. We knew that on the web, the margins are this and the line height is that, and then on mobile it’s this many pixels. After that, you could ask anyone on the team and they can tell you, ‘<q>it’s ten on top and on the sides; on mobile it’s twelve on top and fourteen on the bottom.</q>’ Everyone knew, which was just amazing to me.</p>

        <p class="answer">The incredible thing is the huge effect a small design change can make. Some of them are strategic and you know they will have an effect. And then there have been a few happy accidents, too. ‘<q>Things are up by ten percent! We moved a button!</q>’ Seriously, that can be the difference. Honestly, friction is usually the thing￼I get to work with amazing people on an amazing product, and I’m supporting my family doing what I love. I honestly still pinch myself every once in a while. you’re removing, even if you don’t know you’re doing it.</p>
		<p class="question">How does it feel to work on one of the biggest ‘brands’ on the web? Your work is going to affect millions of people.</p>
        <p class="answer">I think about it and I don’t. Sorry, that’s a horribly vague answer. I don’t think about it in a sense, because I have to set it aside — I would get into paralysis mode if I was constantly thinking about that. At the same time, I realise that I now have a relationship with millions of people. I think of it like, ‘<q>you and I have a point of connection because of this thing that I helped design.</q>’ So I think about it more in terms of a ‘person’ rather than ‘millions of people.’</p>

        <p class="answer">I ask myself, ‘<q>who is the person we’re designing this for?</q>’ Granted, we’ve got this massive range — from brand-new users to people who have been on the service since the beginning — but it’s interesting trying to do that. My daughter should be able to look at the interface and go, ‘<q>oh, I swipe here,</q>’ and ‘<q>oh, I press that.</q>’ Those kinds of things.</p>
        <p class="answer">However, when you have that many users, some things become extremely clear. You start to see patterns. Like, ‘<q>oh man, no-one is clicking on this button we were sure they would click on.</q>’ So it’s obvious when things aren’t working well — you can tell almost right off the bat.</p>
        <p class="answer">At Build, I had somebody come up to me and say, ‘<q>you know, it was fun listening to somebody who has to design for 400 million users.</q>’ That’s the first time I’d ever thought of it that way.</p>
		<p class="question">At the same time, it must be exhilarating to know that the skills that you’ve worked so hard to get — and the path you’ve taken — have such a huge impact.</p>
        <p class="answer">It’s incredibly humbling. I get to work with some of the most incredible people on something that is actually changing the world. It’s funny to say that, because some people say, ‘<q>oh, it’s just a bunch of celebrities talking about what they had for lunch,</q>’ but when you see what happened with the Japan earthquake, or the revolutions in Egypt, it’s incredible.</p>
        <p class="answer">Giving people a voice is, I think, one of the most powerful things we could do. I get to work with amazing people on an amazing product, and I’m supporting my family doing what I love. I honestly still pinch myself every once in a while.</p>
