		<p class="question"> You’re a man of many roles and talents, but let’s kick off by asking how you got to be creative director at MOO.</p>
        <p class="answer">It came about earlier this year when Alex — my brother and business partner — and I had started our Instagoodies side project. We both loved Instrgram and were thinking how great it’d be to get this stuff in physical form. We built something that would kind of make it happen, just as an experiment; certainly nothing we intended to launch. Instagram got in touch with us that same week and said that they were about to have their first worldwide ‘Instameet’ and wanted to do a promotion to give away some of our sticker books.</p>
        <p class="answer">They wanted it the following week so I quickly coded up the work-in-progress wireframes, which is why the original version of the site wasn’t designed at all. All of the orders we’d been processing were done manually because MOO’s API wasn’t able to process orders transparently.</p>
        <p class="answer">I was in London a few months later and went by their offices to talk with them about Instagoodies and their API, saying how we’d love to start promoting our business and making it bigger, but we couldn’t while we were placing every order manually. I must have given them a very impassioned argument about how much I love their brand and product, because the next day I received an email saying, ‘<q>we know this is out of the blue, but are you interested in working for us? We’d love to talk to you about being our creative director.</q>’</p>
        <p class="answer">It wasn’t an immediate, ‘<q>oh, this is great — I’ll have to jump on this,</q>’ moment because I’ve never worked for anybody else. It’s not something I’ve ever looked for. The last four or five years of my life have been really interesting because I’ve gone from never even contemplating working for anyone else to getting some really serious job offers. My first job interview ever was at MSNBC for design director. That’s a lot to wrap your head around when you’re not even looking.</p>
        <p class="answer">I’ve turned them all down because I’ve worked really hard to not work for someone else. I’m confident that I can be successful without an employer: success for me is being in control of my own time. And not living in a box under a bridge!</p>
		<p class="question">Although you didn’t work for anyone else, you did work with your brother Alex. Was your income derived from the work you did together? You both have many side projects, too.

        <p class="answer">The business has been our only source of income. We formed the company to be able to help out our Mum while our Dad recovered from health issues, and to be able to spend a lot of time singing. We were basically spending most of our time doing chorus and quartet stuff — which didn’t pay any money — and doing an incredibly small amount of work to get paid.</p>
        <p class="answer">It hasn’t really been run like a business at all. It’s been like this thing we do because we enjoy it and then people pay us sometimes. That doesn’t lead to a lot of growth at all. We’ve had moments where we’ve had really good years, where we’ve contemplated taking on employees and getting an office. But this is really a lifestyle business and if we had employees we couldn’t do our singing and we’d have to actually pay attention to the inner workings of the company!</p>
		<p class="question">You must’ve seen a lot of friends go from being a sole designer to a first-hire, and then within two or three years they’re up to ten and then suddenly you’re feeding the beast.</p>
        <p class="answer">For years people would ask, ‘<q>when are you going to hire people?</q>’ That’s the only way that some people can measure success. For me and Alex, it’s a conscious decision to not have employees, to not grow in that way.</p>
        <p class="answer">I’m not a businessman. There’s a part of me that can think very clearly about the large scale business goals, but the day- to-day management of a business isn’t one of my strengths.</p>
        <p class="answer">The experience I have has been self-taught and that’s not good. I don’t think that’s a good way of doing it. I wouldn’t recommend it to anybody because I don’t have the head for it.</p>
		<p class="question">You do seem to have a head for public speaking, though. How did you get your first speaking gig and what was the personal motivation?</p>
        <p class="answer">I’m lucky to be comfortable on stage in front of a crowd — a few decades of singing in small and large ensembles helps make that easier than it is for some people. I started speaking at conferences the same way I’ve started down many paths: by saying yes when asked, without thinking of the consequences, or if I’d be any good at it. I enjoy sharing what I know, and it sounded like a good way to do that. I had co-authored Pro CSS Techniques with Jeff Croft and Ian Lloyd, and that led to me speaking first at one event, then another, and another, and I just kept saying yes whenever anyone asked.</p>
        <p class="answer">I’m completely aware that if you ask me about any of the topics that I’ve spoken about in the last four or five years, I could name five to ten people — at least — who would be so much more knowledgeable than me, and who I think should be speaking about those subjects instead of me.</p>
        <p class="answer">I accept that role because the reason I do it is not for self promotion or for gigs. I think the only work that I’ve received as a result of speaking has been more speaking.</p>
        <p class="answer">Since I don’t rigorously charge for speaking, then that’s not actually work. This is not a good biz-dev thing.</p>

		<p class="question">What would be your counsel to someone who does see speaking as the fast track to credibility or to work?
        <p class="answer">People in the audience are in the trenches and you don’t always see that with the people who are up on stage. This has become a big psychological issue for me: that I’m one of those people who would look at me standing up on stage and ask, ‘<q>what the hell is he doing up there? I don’t actually know what Dan has done lately.</q>’ There’s this perception that if you’re well- known, it has to be for something other than speaking, and I think it’s important to establish yourself and your reputation for what you do by doing it, not by speaking about it.
        <p class="answer">I’m really not a confident person when it comes to the work I do. This is a common thread for a lot of creatives — we all try to do ￼our best and we try to do great things, but many of us are never content with the end result. My best ideas aren’t client projects, and I don’t know how to get them funded because I don’t have the business experience. I have a lot of people I know I could ask, but I’m horrible at asking for help. This year is probably the first year that I’ve done a really good job of asking for help and I’ve done it by way of giving up control. In the last six months I’ve taken on client projects that have required several people to work on them due to their size and complexity; meaning other people are doing things that I normally would do myself, which I’ve never really done before. I’ve always built teams around the skills I don’t have, so this has been a great learning experience in collaborative design and creative direction.
        <p class="answer">Apple is still my marker for quality of execution, but even more for their quality of vision. When the iPad came out, Alex and I immediately recognised it as one of those things that ten years from now — twenty or fifty years from now — everyone is going to point to as a game-changer. That’s what I look for in Apple and that’s what I look for in the people I surround myself with.
		<p class="question">Do you find you tend to surround yourself with people of a similar nature?
        <p class="answer">That was one of the huge appeals of MOO for me, and also because they perfectly marry the disciplines of print and the web. They have multiple physical products — including their packaging and accessories — but their only storefront is on the web, so all of my experience in that area can go into that. While I don’t know as much about the print world as I did ten years ago, I know enough to get back up to speed quickly, especially when surrounded with a talented team I can trust. It’s that eighty percent thing: the idea that a lot of creatives don’t have to know a hundred percent about about something in order to help improve it. We need to know just enough to start applying our problem-solving skills, and then work with others to help bring those ideas to fruition.
        <p class="answer">That said, I’m realising the last few years that that’s an issue for me, and for Alex, too: We’re both stubborn eighty percenters. I’ve surrounded myself over the last few years with exactly the right people; I just don’t ask them for help.
        <p class="answer">I think I’ve tended to seek out other eighty-percenters in the past, and it doesn’t always make for a good partnership on a project. I’ve done that a few times and it doesn’t work too well — not because they’re bad at anything; I’m just learning I need someone who’s excellent at that other twenty percent.
		<p class="question">It’s hard to choose the right people to work with, or be lucky enough to find those who do complement your skills.
        <p class="answer">That in itself is a skill — to be able to recognise what you need and what other people have, and then to make those connections for yourself. I’m always making those connections for other people. I love connecting people who need each other. I’ll have a conversation with someone where they’re just listing out things they want to do and stuff they don’t know how to complete, and I’ll instantly jump to, ‘<q>okay, you need to talk to this person.</q>’

        <p class="answer">I never ask other people for those connections for myself, though. Again, it’s the stubborn mindset that I should be able to finish this on my own. If it doesn’t get completed, or if it doesn’t launch, then I only have myself to blame. It’s a horrible way to actually get anything done!
        <p class="answer">It’s hard to be a creative director when you’re also the designer. But it gets easier the more people you have helping you. You have to acknowledge that no matter how much you know, getting the job done is a very different thing than knowing it all.
        <p class="answer">I’ve found this really hard over the last year. Whenever I hear myself referring to our community as ‘the industry’, I’ve been thinking, ‘<q>what the hell is this industry anyway?</q>’ It isn’t the web. Some people are in the medical industry. They’re doing things on the web, but the web isn’t their industry. As designers, when I say the industry, do I mean design? Do I mean the web? Do I mean interaction design? Do I mean print? Do I mean communication? What do I mean? The problems we’re solving aren’t so contained that anyone can master the process. If we’re to be successful, we all need help on a much broader range of subjects and skills than ever before.
		<p class="question">As web people doing web things, we seem to be creating a lot of problems that we then try to solve with a web app. Would you agree?
        <p class="answer">What we’re doing when we’re building a web app is we’re designing software. The delivery mechanism is the web browser, but it’s not a website anymore. There’s a huge difference: websites and web apps are two different creatures. The fact that the web is the common delivery system almost doesn’t matter because of the way they’re built and the way you have to think about them.
        <p class="answer">There’s much more in common between a web app and a native desktop or mobile application than there is with a website. There’s also much more in common between a brochure and a website than many people would like to admit. Let’s not build up what we do into some fantastic thing. I think that happens too frequently in software design, that a lot of software is designed to solve a problem that — as you say — doesn’t really exist to the extent the person designing the software thinks it does. It makes things more complex more often than it makes things easier and it’s something I hate about the world of software.</p>

        <p class="answer">It’s worse with web apps because we’re getting more and more examples now of money getting thrown at things. Color is the easiest app to call out. It’s not purely a web app, but it’s a web-API-native hybrid, which is becoming a very common approach to harnessing the web in software design. Many millions of dollars were invested in it and an obscene amount of money was spent on buying the color.com domain. But what problem was it solving? Of course, we could ask, ‘<q>what problem is Instagram solving?</q>’ I try to play devil’s advocate with these things because I think it’s too easy to get caught up in the excitement of something new.</p>
        <p class="answer">Instagram didn’t create a problem. They didn’t introduce the idea of photo sharing, they just simplified the process. They solved a problem other people hadn’t recognised, and they didn’t make anything worse while solving it. They didn’t make anyone’s life more complex. They added a lot of richness to peoples’ lives who now have a community they didn’t have before. That’s where you get something successful. I think there’s too much focus on, ‘<q>if you think of a problem, then there must be a problem,</q>’ as opposed to making sure that what you’re identifying as a problem is actually a real one in the first place.</p>
        <p class="answer">That’s the thing we try to do for clients. Someone comes to you with what they perceive to be a problem. If you’re good at what you do and you’re responsible — sadly a lot of agencies aren’t; they just take someone’s money and say, ‘<q>sure, we’ll fix that problem for you!</q>’ — you make sure the problem really exists, and if it doesn’t, you tell them, ‘<q>what you think is the problem, isn’t. Here’s what really needs solving.</q>’</p>
        <p class="answer">Responsible designers, agencies, and creative practitioners will turn down a project when we know the problem we’re being asked to solve doesn’t need solving. I hope I’m not the only person who turns down those projects.</p>
