		<p class="question">What’s a typical day like for you?</p>
		<p class="answer">There isn’t a typical day because I’m involved in so many different side projects that every day kind of just makes itself. Some days I’m in the studio, working on stuff for Typekit; other days I’m out of the studio, teaching up at the school, or writing. It’s just all over the place and a lot of people ask me, ‘<q>how do you get stuff done — do you have any free time?</q>’ It’s not that all these things are occupying all of my time; they’re just all vying for attention at any given time.</p>
		<p class="question">What are you teaching at <a id="noterefJSM001"></a><a href="#noteJSM001" class="footnotelink">SVA <b>1</b></a>?</p>
		<p class="answer">My class is called ‘Craft and Communication’ and it looks at where visual design meets interaction. At what point do we have to be able to comprehend something to engage with something? What elements of the visual design lend or detract from that activity? It’s very much a typical visual design course, but focused more heavily on everyday interaction.</p>
		<p class="question">That sounds quite encouraging because there’s been a lot of writing on the web recently about how poor formal education in the technology industry is. Do you think you guys are trailblazing or is it something which, in America, is happening a lot?</p>
		<p class="answer">This is definitely unique as there aren’t very many programmes worldwide like this, but I think it’s gaining traction. The nice things about SVA is that everyone working is not a full-time instructor; they’re working during the day. So everyone is very up on the current methods of things, which is very useful to the students.</p>
		<p class="question">We wanted to ask you about the whole Philly thing. You, <a id="noterefJSM002"></a><a href="#noteJSM002" class="footnotelink">Rob <b>2</b></a>, <a id="noterefJSM003"></a><a href="#noteJSM003" class="footnotelink">Dan <b>3</b></a> — did you guys all go to school together?</p>
		<p class="answer">Rob and I went to school together. Rob was the first person I met at college and he was one of the people who influenced me to become a designer. I was an illustrator beforehand and that’s what I always wanted to do. I was just one of those kids who was good at art and I could draw so I thought, ‘<q>maybe I’ll be an illustrator, and maybe I’ll draw comic books.</q>’ I had no idea what college was about, or where I wanted to go, and somebody said, ‘<q>hey, this college has a really good art programme,’ so I went, ‘alright, I guess I’ll go apply here.</q>’</p>

		<!-- END a Pullquote figure //-->

        <p>That was the amount of research that I did. I filled out an application and I sent my stuff off, and it was probably one of the only colleges for art that you didn’t need a portfolio to get into — you had to take an ‘art test’, which was a handful of assignments. Somehow I got in and it turned out to be a really good school for art and design.</p>
        <p>After about a year or two taking all the foundation courses, which were the same for illustrators or designers, I realised I wasn’t cut out for illustration. I didn’t have the love for it that I thought I had. I’d seen a lot of other people around the program that were doing design work and computer and graphic design. I had no idea what any of that was, but I started to ask more questions and I decided I wanted to switch over to that major.</p>
		<p class="question">That was mainly print design rather than web?</p>
		<p class="answer">Right. This was back in the late nineties, so the web was a thing, but it wasn’t a big thing. They weren’t teaching it yet. We learned Macromedia Director — that was our interaction course. We learned print design — Quark and applications like that — but it was a very good program because it was centred around visual thinking. They gave you a little, rough introduction to the tools, but it was very focused on idea development, conceptual development, and critique.</p>
        <p>It was a fantastic structure because it doesn’t matter that much about the tools. You’re going to have your entire life to learn about tools, but if you’re not a good thinker from the get-go and if you don’t develop your mind, you’re lost. I think that’s the most powerful tool you can have. It sounds trite, but it’s true because that’s what sets you apart. You can always get better at Photoshop, but have to sharpen your mind first.</p>
		<p class="question">What happened after school?</p>
		<p class="answer">I got out of school and I got what I thought was my dream job: a really great, small, boutique agency just outside of Philadelphia, split pretty much right down the middle between web and print. I’d taken an internal web design summer course, which was as far as I’d got into web design at school, because there weren’t any classes for it. I liked it so much that I started really getting into it on my own, so a lot of it was self-taught. I got in on the merit of the print design work I’d been doing and I knew I could learn about this web stuff on the job. In a year and half I was ‘the web guy’ and in another six months I was art director.</p>

        <p>In my next job, we had one intern that we really struggled with. It contrasted so heavily because our other intern was Dan Mall, who was still in school, but he was good enough that we were actually giving him real work. Fantastically talented, really driven — a smart guy.</p>
        <p>After I moved on from this agency Dan gave us a call and he was at school and was working at this little web-specific startup from a larger company in Philadelphia. They wanted a brand new school of designers, so they brought on me and Rob. The company was Pixel Worthy, started by Greg Hoy. It was basically groundwork for what later became Happy Cog Philadelphia. Greg figured out a lot on these larger companies’ dime and they assembled a really good team of people. When that went south, he talked to Jeffrey and they decided they were going to open a Philadelphia office.</p>
		<p class="question">When Happy Cog came together, did your role and location change?</p>
		<p class="answer">No, that was the genesis of my random collection of roles, because I was splitting my time between the two offices. I worked at the Philadelphia office because that was easier, but split my work time on projects from the New York side and the Philly side. I was creative director on both ends and kind of helping to manage the workflow.</p>
		<p class="question">What was your reason for leaving Happy Cog? Unlike a lot of people who leave agencies, you not only have a really good relationship with them, but you’re also still involved in projects with that circle of people.</p>
		<p class="answer">That’s just it: it was different from any other time I left a job in the past, where I’d left because I was tired of the people, or tired of the work. With Happy Cog, I love all these people and so many are my friends — and feel like family — but at the same time, I just needed a change.</p>
        <p>I found myself in a period where I was running through the same paces over and over again from project to project. I wasn’t always sure if the things I designed were making a difference. I felt like there was something else out there that I could find more fulfilling. It had nothing to do with Happy Cog.</p>
		<p class="question">At Typekit you’re creative director. It’s probably quite different to an agency creative director?</p>
		<p class="answer">Absolutely. My role at Typekit is not only to be the individual design voice, but also to help out with the rest of the team, deciding what fonts we want to take on when we talk to a foundry or when a foundry approaches us. We go through the library and we talk about balancing what we already have. We don’t want to just select every font ever in the system, because that serves to devalue what’s there. We find a balance.</p>
		<p class="question">When you joined, were you in at the inception of the service?</p>
		<p class="answer">Yes. I’m not one of the founders, but I was there from pretty much the beginning, and that came about because Jeff and I met up a few times at conferences and just got talking. I’d also shown him <a id="noterefJSM004"></a><a href="#noteJSM004" class="footnotelink">Typedia <b>4</b></a> at the launch and he knew that I was a ridiculous type nerd. I love design, I love education about type — all the pieces were there.</p>
		<p class="question">What’s your level of involvement with A Book Apart? Do you get involved in the day-to-day processes?</p>
		<p class="answer">We’ve actually split up the processes pretty well. Mandy usually handles more of the concept side of things and we all discuss what would be a good title for us, and we make the decisions together, but when the action comes through — handling the content, shaping the story — I’ll handle more of the visual design things and do the website. Work gets divided pretty easily down those lines.</p>
		<p class="question">Are you surprised by the fact that physical books are doing so well in the digital age? We’re guessing your physical sales outsell your electronic sales?</p>
		<p class="answer">I believe so, but the electronic kind of stuff is steadily on the rise, which is good. But yes, I’m surprised. Not surprised that people want high-quality, educational content, but surprised with how engaged the community still is in stuff like this. We worked really hard to make something good, so it feels fantastic when people like it and really get the idea of the series.</p>
        <p>I remember my favourite part was before we’d even released the second book; people got the premise just from Jeremy’s alone and from the tagline, ‘brief books’. They’re not going to be a comprehensive guide, but you get everything you need to know in a really small package. That made me happy because I didn’t know that people would get that straight off the bat. It sounds silly, but that was one of our concerns: that people wouldn’t understand what stories we were trying to tell.</p>
		<p class="question">You’re actually writing for the series now, aren’t you? As it’s on web typography, will you be looking at all the latest thoughts and trends, or will you be taking a different angle?</p>
		<p class="answer">Yeah and it’s going to be the next one. I’m more interested in the aesthetic — the conceptual quality of typography — than I am on the technical side. I think that if you talk about why you’re doing something — not just the letter-spacing or text size, but why you’re approaching the spacing like that — it’s just so much more valuable. Some people might know the code to make something, but they don’t actually have the knowledge of why they’re doing it. They don’t have the language of typography, they don’t know how to talk about fonts, they don’t necessarily choose a font based on its aesthetic qualities, or they don’t know how to pair that with another typeface.</p>
		<p class="question">And with web type, technology dates so quickly. Is this going to be a general guide to typography, but aimed at web designers?</p>
		<p class="answer">Right. It’s also going to look at the web as a medium because I think that affects typography a lot. There could be stuff in there about code, but like you said, it’s a bit dated and it’s easy enough to say, ‘<q>go and look at this tutorial — this will show you how to put your font in a style sheet and hook it up to Google Fonts, Fontdeck, or Typekit.</q>’</p>

        <p>I want to talk about typography from a design standpoint because so many of us from the web haven’t necessarily gone to design school for training — we’re either self-taught or we come from technical backgrounds. It’s really important to share this information: to make it approachable and break down any sort of barriers for people who feel like they don’t know enough, or at least have enough knowledge to be comfortable talking to other designers about it.</p>
		<p class="question">Are you still doing client work?</p>
		<p class="answer">Yeah, I started <a id="noterefJSM005"></a><a href="#noteJSM005" class="footnotelink">Mighty <b>5</b></a> a couple of years ago, even though I’d been working under the name for about a year before I had time to make a website. I usually only take on maybe one project at a time and it’s usually something manageable — it’s either short and sweet or long and comfortable.</p>
		<p>You can spend a lot of time lounging on it for four of five months and then just peck away at it. I think it’s nice to have that outlet because I do enjoy the odd client job, but I’m happy that I’m not doing client work full-time.</p>
		<p class="question">With all your other things going on, it must be quite a small portion of your time?</p>
		<p class="answer">Very small. Right now, I don’t even have a job that I’m working on with Mighty. Over the summer I did a very small engagement with Marco from Instapaper. We basically just cleaned it up. Dan Cederholm and I got together and we worked on making new icons — it’s the same icon, but better. I took some of the typography and I did really simple things like pulling out the URL and just structuring the content a little bit. It looks even better on the iPad because it has this new grid view: there are squares rather than just a list.</p>
		<p class="question">Is there any stuff happening that we can talk about?</p>
		<p class="answer">Well, a lot of fun stuff like Typekit. We’re really pushing out this second edition of all the client-facing, user-facing stuff. Currently it’s a straight line between, ‘<q>I like a font and I want to use it,</q>’ to, ‘<q>I’m using it on my site.</q>’ I’m looking at this process — anything can happen between, ‘<q>I like that font,</q>’ and, ‘<q>do I actually want to use it?</q>’ There’s so much decision-making, there’s so much education: like playing around with the typefaces and getting a feel for them. I’ve seen typefaces that I love, want to buy, and when I try to use it, I’m like, ‘<q>I don’t like this anymore — this isn’t what I wanted.</q>’ I think that there’s so much conversation that can happen in the type selection process. We’re just about to launch a new interface for the ‘Browse’ section and Mandy, Tim, and I basically stripped back all the metadata for all the fonts and we retagged everything. We came up with a different classification system and we looked at every font again.</p>
		<p class="question">When you look back over your career to date, is there anything you’re particularly proud of, or any projects that didn’t go the way you thought they would?</p>
		<p class="answer">Everyone makes mistakes and that’s kind of what helps you to not make those mistakes again, but the really good stuff is that I love all the people I’ve had the chance to work with. A List Apart is still one of my favourite designs because it’s still going strong and it’s still really sturdy.</p>
        <p>All of the stuff I’m working on right now — like teaching — is so fulfilling, but also shows me just how far I need to go to actually be good at teaching. I’ve got a long way to go before I feel like I’m really capable of the level of teaching that I want to be at. But teaching people about type — which is of my favourite things, although I don’t know that I planned it all — just came together that way. I’m passionate about it all and I think that’s what keeps me interested every day.</p>
