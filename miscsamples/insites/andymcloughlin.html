		<p class="question">You started Huddle with your business partner Alastair. What was your journey up to that point?</p>
        <p class="answer">I did a degree in economics, but had run a web design shop from when I was seventeen until I was twenty-one because it paid better than working in a supermarket. This was from 1996 until 2000 or so, back when anybody could be a web designer.</p>
        <p class="answer">My first proper job was working for a telco doing a lot of CSS, ASP, and DHTML! The final project I did before I left was to put in a web-based document management system. As a result I ended up doing a lot of consultancy around web-based business process systems for a couple of years. I was bored by the end of it. I wanted to go back to working with the web, doing stuff that was outward-facing, where I could wear jeans every day.</p>
        <p class="answer">Alastair was an old friend who I’d known for a few years. We were talking one evening about what we might like to do. We both had the same idea to build a business system that wasn’t branded like a business system; it would have a friendly brand that people liked. It wasn’t going to be sold like a business system, but would be priced in a way that a company of fifty people or 50,000 people could roll out.</p>
        <p class="answer">We’d run it like a cool software shop: we’d wear jeans to work and have drinks during the week. We left our jobs at the end of 2006 and Huddle officially launched midway through 2007.</p>
		<p class="question">Was it hard leaving your jobs?</p>
        <p class="answer">Absolute wing and a prayer! But the job market at that point was still pretty good. Had it not worked out I could have gone back to my previous job and put my suit back on. Alastair is a super smart guy; he could have gone and done anything else afterwards.</p>
        <p class="answer">For the first few months it felt a bit like a game. We were ￼running around London having meetings with people and talking to our software developers, designing what the product would do, and writing our brand value statement — all that kind of stuff you do when you’re still not entirely sure exactly what it is you should be doing.</p>
		<p class="question">Did you have the name at this point?</p>
        <p class="answer">No, we didn’t. We knew what the product was going to do and we had a million different terrible names for it. We would give each other different jobs and meet a couple of times a week. I would be wireframing the product or looking after the website, and Ali would be learning about company formation and tax.</p>

		<p class="answer">As he was light on duties one week, he took the job of creating a spreadsheet of fifty names we might call this collaborative teamwork product. He came back with this huge list — and I think all of them apart from one were terrible — but there was one, and that was Huddle.</p>
        <p class="answer">From that moment we actually had a brand and a name for it. I designed a logo, which we kept until last year.</p>
        <p class="answer">From the very beginning the Huddle brand was one of the most powerful things we had. It so accurately summarised what the product was meant to do. It wasn’t a storage product; it wasn’t just a project management product; we were trying to do something bigger than that, which was collaboration. Huddle was the perfect name for a team collaboration product.</p>
		<p class="question">When you first started out, were you effectively working out of your bedrooms?</p>
        <p class="answer">Yes, I was working in my bedroom, and Alastair was working out of his study. We communicated a lot on Skype, but I ended up getting cabin fever. Working alone from 8am until midnight isn’t healthy. Thankfully we soon got an office that we ended up filling. Our first office was near Waterloo, then we moved to Bermondsey St. Last year we moved to a big, beautiful office right on <a id="noterefAM001"></a><a href="#noteAM001" class="footnotelink">Silicon Roundabout <b>1</b></a>.</p>
		<p class="question">You collaborated with another company for your development, didn’t you?</p>
        <p class="answer">Yes, we did it on a project basis with an external software development company. Now I know there’s a huge amount of benefit in having a technical team from day one; even if you do outsource some of the work, having someone who lives and breathes code inside the business is really important.
        <p class="answer">When we decided to bring the work in-house, we realised that we needed to hire an engineering team. The first hire we made was a guy called Bohus, who was Slovenian.
		<p class="question">Was? Is he no longer with us?</p>
        <p class="answer">He’s still a Slovenian, but I think he was living in Prague at the time. He wanted to move to the UK. His English wasn’t particularly good, but he had a good skill set and he was cheap, and we didn’t have a lot of money at the time.</p>
        <p class="answer">He moved over from Prague and lived in a one-bedroom flat with his mum near Victoria in Pimlico. We did say you could probably afford to get a two-bedroom flat elsewhere in London, but he said, ‘<q>no, I like Pimlico.</q>’</p>
        <p class="answer">When you look back, you realise the business is made up of so many characters; some of them still work with us and some don’t. Bodus was a real character. Every day he would come in with a duffel bag. At 3pm on the dot he would open this duffel bag and get out a big two-litre bottle of Fanta, and he’d drink the entire thing. That would go back in the bag and then he would bring out a big lump of Battenberg cake, which would be demolished <q>[re-enacts cake disappearing into mouth]</q>. This would happen every single day at 3pm on the dot.</p>
		<p class="question">Were you funded at this point?</p>
        <p class="answer">Early in 2007 we decided that we should get a bit of funding just to help us continue to grow, because we wanted to hire more developers, a customer service person, and a sales person.</p>

        <p class="answer">We decided to look for some angel investment. I remember reading a book called The Beermat Entrepreneur by Mike Southern. The one thing that really stuck in my mind after reading it was, ‘<q>a way to a rich man’s wallet is via his PA</q>’.</p>
        <p class="answer">I once worked for a rich man who was in the process of selling his company, so the light bulb went on. I said to Alastair that we should talk to Charles McGregor. He’d had a business called Fibernet, which had gone public, and they were in the throes of selling it to a big American firm.</p>
        <p class="answer">I got in touch with his PA, Kathy, as I’d always got on with her very well. She spoke to Charles and explained what we do, and that we’d like him to be involved and talk about an investment. At the time we were naïve and had no idea how to value the business, so we came up with a ludicrous number and said to Charles that we would sell him a few percent for some ungodly fee, and he said, ‘<q>okay!</q>’ So that was where we got our first round of funding from. That allowed us to continue to grow the team.</p>
		<p class="question">How involved was he from then onwards?</p>
        <p class="answer">At that point he joined our board. He’s been our chairman ever since. We’d meet every month and tell him what was going on and he’d tell us his view on what we should be doing. He’s been incredibly supportive and a great mentor.</p>

		<p class="question">Ultimately you raised another round — how did that happen?</p>
        <p class="answer">We thought we should go and talk to some VCs and see if they thought there was a good opportunity here, because a VC should not just be about giving you money; they should actually be able to assist you with advice, contacts, and business development to really help you grow your business.</p>
        <p class="answer">The thing you have to bear in mind is that they’re in the business of making money, so they can be a great partner, but at the end of the day they’re in this for their own gain.</p>
        <p class="answer">We closed in October 2007 and we raised £2m from Eden Ventures.</p>

        <p class="question">Recently you moved across the pond and raised further investment in The States. Do you notice a difference between VC culture in the UK and over here?</p>
        <p class="answer">The big difference between the UK VC and the US VC is a question of scale. The UK VC might have a few hundred million pounds under management, whereas some of the big US VCs have tens of billions of dollars under management.</p>
        <p class="answer">We were very lucky to have met some really good VCs out here: companies who were not going to make us move the entire business from London to the Valley. We always will be and always have been a UK business, and we’re very happy to be flying the British flag out here.</p>

		<p class="question">Let’s talk about acquiring customers. How do you convince large companies to use Huddle?</p>
		<p class="answer">We have two sides of that. The first side is the sales: getting the company on board and selling to them. Once the sale has been made, that’s the start; then that’s when the customer success team come in.</p>
		<p class="answer">The best part of selling on the web is taking advantage of social media, taking advantage of having a great brand, and taking advantage of events. We acquire customers through natural search, and pay-per-click: Adwords is huge for us. You would not believe the number of people that search for stuff like, ‘<q>enterprise content management,</q>’ or, ‘<q>SharePoint alternative,</q>’ or, ‘<q>Basecamp for enterprise.</q>’</p>
		<p class="answer">That provides a huge feeder for us. Then we combine that with more traditional PR, such as opinion pieces and big blogs.</p>
￼￼
        <p class="question">What made you start DrinkTank London — your regular startup-focussed meetup?</p>
        <p class="answer">Alastair and I were at Le Web just after we closed our funding and I remember talking with Sokratis from TrustedPlaces and Andrew from Idiomag, and it struck us that it was ridiculous that we had to go all the way to Paris in order to have a drink and chat with our friends. So at that point we thought, ‘<q>let’s start an event.</q>’ Huddle was going great and we had a bit more free time, so we could actually afford to do something that would be enjoyable as well. Alastair and I both contend that we came up with the name DrinkTank, but it was absolutely me that invented it, not him. <q>[laughs]</q></p>

	    <p class="answer">Our first event was held in a club that was partly owned by our lawyer, so we got it free. I think we invited thirty or forty people we knew, and said that if you want to bring a friend, that’s cool. I think that first night we had eighty people there. It went on from there, and more and more people came. It was really cool because it meant that almost instantly there was a scene.</p>
        <p class="answer">It felt very co-operative and we always said that we weren’t doing it for revenue. We didn’t charge people to come, and we made sure there were free drinks provided by our sponsor. Huddle never made a penny out of it.</p>
        <p class="answer">I know there were deals done — even in the first couple of months — that have led to great stuff: investments and great partnerships have been made. That’s why we did it. It was fun and everyone likes free drinks.</p>
		<p class="question">What’s life like in the Valley?</p>
        <p class="answer">I think the first thing is deciding where you really want to be: do you want to be in San Francisco or Silicon Valley? Because they’re two very different things. I think that five years ago it was much more popular for companies to startup in the Valley. San Francisco was pretty dead. Now most companies I know that are starting up are based here. San Francisco is a great place to live.</p>
		<p class="question">Do you find it hard to stay motivated working on one product?</p>
        <p class="answer">I’ve been lucky enough to invest in a few other companies so I can feed my startup junkie addiction by helping those guys out. My friends would be asking me for advice anyway, so this way it’s a bit more of a two-way street and I can invest in their success as well. But really Huddle is my pride and joy; it’s my shiny car that I want to drive the most.</p>
		<p class="question">What is the biggest lesson or bit of advice you would give to someone in a similar position to yourself five or six years ago?</p>
        <p class="answer">Be ballsy. Whatever you think you’re worth, triple it because that’s a good place to start. Be laser-focused on building innovative products. And make sure you’ve got a great technical team to help you deliver it, because without a great product you’re never going to build a great product business.</p>
