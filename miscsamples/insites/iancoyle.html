		<p class="question">You once said that if you can have four good clients a year and you charge enough to see you through, you’d be happy. How do you get to the point of being able to pick and choose?</p>
        <p class="answer">I remember that talk and at that time I was at six or eight clients. I’d just left my first agency, and had opened a hybrid letterpress and interaction studio in Colorado. As an independent creative, when you have more than eight clients, your attention is so split that you can’t dedicate the time needed to really think through a project. When you’re first starting out, you need to do as much work as possible in order to learn and become secure in your talent and ability. And once you have, you can begin to focus on becoming a partner with your clients in order to create the best work.</p>
		<p class="question">By the time you felt secure in your talents, how long had you been in the industry?</p>
        <p class="answer">It was about five or six years from when I started my first agency. I realised I’d paid my dues as a programmer and designer, and I had the trade down enough to be able to start focusing more on storytelling and interaction.</p>
		<p class="question">To back-track a little, how did you get started?</p>
        <p class="answer">I grew up in Europe, spending ten years in Italy, and when I was young I started out by doing freelance web design and development for small Italian companies, just learning about the internet. My first website was for an Italian cement mixer manufacturer and my second was for a water treatment facility. With the exchange rate at the time, I earned six dollars a page! When I returned to the States on an engineering scholarship I realised I liked the technical and problem- solving side, but really I wanted to be creative.</p>

        <p class="answer">I ended up dropping out. I knew what I wanted to do, so I decided to try out a freelance studio and about a year in ￼￼I met my first business partner. Like myself, he had just started his own company, and Hewlett-Packard had come to him with a last-minute project. He called me late Friday night with a crazy proposal and said, ‘<q>hey, can we take this whole thing and redo it by Monday morning at eight? We only get paid if they like it, but it’s a huge opportunity.</q>’ I stayed up for about seventy-two hours straight, we presented it, and they loved it. When you’re young and getting started, you have to take risks — and through it we realised we worked well together, so we started a small studio that grew into a twenty-five person agency. About seven or eight years in I realised that I was doing more management than I was design, and I wasn’t able to focus on the trade and the craft. I left that studio and I started a letterpress shop to focus on typography as a craft and really hone my design cycle.</p>

		<p class="question">When you started out it was more development than design. Obviously you’re unusual because your skills lie on each side of that coin, but how did you get started specifically in design? Did you have any formal training?</p>
        <p class="answer">It may sound odd today, but when I was young I didn’t realise that design was a trade. My father worked for a NATO base in Europe and I went to school in a military base in Italy. The only opportunities, it seemed, were the traditional doctor, lawyer, engineer, or architect, and I realised early on that I was not suited for the military.</p>
        <p class="answer">Engineering appealed to me because I got to work with computers. But the first time I saw Photoshop, my world changed! I typeset, ‘<q>hello world,</q>’ and it was anti-aliased and I totally freaked out. I was so excited because I’d been using MS Paint before that, which had no anti- aliasing. That was when I started to figure out for myself that it was actually design and typography that I loved, and engineering just happened to be my way in.</p>

		<p class="question">Because you know your way around the JavaScript and interaction stuff, which side do you start from? Do you think, ‘<q>I’ve got an idea for a transition,</q>’ or do you come from, ‘<q>I’ve got this great image, so how do I move that around?</q>’</p>
        <p class="answer">It really depends on what the inspiration is. There are times when Duane and I will start throwing visuals back and forth, just trying to nail a visual tone. And a lot of times, that’s the first thing we look for: a really strong visual tone. Other times, it’s just like, ‘<q>hey, there’s an idea for interaction that I really think could work,</q>’ so we jump right into prototyping, or we design it in code. I’m probably the worst Photoshopper because I’ll do a mood in Photoshop, jump to code, make sure an interaction looks good, then screenshot that, jump back into Photoshop, then move things around, and keep doing that ad infinitum.</p>
		<p class="question">How long did something like <a id="noterefIC001"></a><a href="#noteIC001" class="footnotelink">Edits <b>1</b></a> take from concept to fruition?</p>
        <p class="answer">It’s hard to say 100% because I thought about the site concept as I was traveling back home to Italy for my thirtieth birthday, and it inspired me to do something more personal. As far as coding and design goes, the first prototype of the site was done over a weekend. After that, it took another month to finesse it. I kept looking at it and it didn’t feel as editorial as I wanted, so I kept tweaking it. I never really set out to do a magazine with it; I just knew I had stories I wanted to tell, and in the end I was trying to explore a new way to tell narratives online.</p>
		<p class="question">Whenever we stumble across any references to you and <a id="noterefIC002"></a><a href="#noteIC002" class="footnotelink">Duane <b>2</b></a>, the bio says, ‘<q>Ian and Duane run a studio in Portland,</q>’ and there’s never a link; there’s never anything explicit. You’ve only recently just put your own portfolio online.</p>
        <p class="answer">This is the first time in eight years that I’ve had a design portfolio. I’ve always been fairly elusive, but I think I naturally prefer having no visible presence, except by people who know me personally. I stayed under the radar and I guess it just kept getting worse and worse, and then two years ago I quit Twitter. It really started out as an experiment and it got to a point where I guess I kind of felt like there were fewer and fewer things about Twitter I found interesting. I feel like Twitter didn’t help me come to any better ideas and it didn’t make me more inspired. In fact the opposite, probably. What’s crazy to think about is I missed the launch of Google+ and Instagram in the last few years. In the time that I’ve been off, a lot has totally passed me by.</p>
		<p class="question">Do you find that the web industry has too much of a reliance on things like Twitter?</p>
        <p class="answer">I can’t speak for everyone, because Twitter is what you do with it, but for me Twitter is, at best, a tiny microcosm of what we do in our lives, and doesn’t represent the full picture. As obvious as it may sound, after spending two years away I realised how much time on Twitter is spent worrying about the picture of your life instead of living it.</p>
        <p class="answer">But for our industry, it is important, and I’ve recently, albeit tentatively, rejoined. Whether we’d like to admit it, it’s also a currency at some level. For clients, for potential clients, for other designers, that stuff matters. However, I missed the connections that I’ve made through Twitter and I’m happy to reconnect with people who obviously aren’t right next door to you.</p>
		<p class="question">A lot of people use Twitter as a marketing channel: a way of putting themselves out there and building up a personality. In terms of marketing, you seem to not need any, so it’d be interesting to talk to you about how your reputation came to the fore and how you were able to sustain a clearly successful studio by ducking out of these things.</p>
        <p class="answer">The easy answer is honestly, ‘<q>I don’t know.</q>’ I’ve been exceptionally fortunate to work with great clients who allow me to constantly push the boundaries of design, interaction, and storytelling. I think people see the craft behind the projects and it’s enabled me to stay at the forefront of people’s minds.</p>

        <p class="answer">For years I had a limited online presence and I think it helped qualify inquiries. Even Duane had to look through the code of an old site that I did to track me down to work with me the first time we collaborated. And I think that level of resistance filters out some of the people who aren’t that interested.</p>
		<p class="question">So after Duane tracked you down through your source code, how did that blossom into the creative partnership you’ve got going on now?</p>
        <p class="answer">When he reached out, he was living in Santa Fe and I was living in Denver. I was running the letterpress studio, but also doing limited interaction work on the side. We did an Italian glassware manufacturing site together — in maybe 2008 — and then we just started working together. After that we did Thinking for a Living and then we both moved out to Portland to share this office space. We knew we wanted to work together, but we didn’t really have any plans. We just worked at the same desk, and we worked well together and then it organically grew to a point where it just made sense to form a partnership.</p>

		<p class="question">You obviously have a keen interest in cutting-edge browser developments. How do you learn new technologies? Is it a natural curiosity or do you just like pushing the boundaries to see what you can do?</p>
        <p class="answer">Every now and then I’ll find inspiration, typically from something non-digital, and my curiosity drives me to do explore. I always seem to have two or three other site designs that I’ve coded fully, but haven’t launched. I get an idea and then I quickly whip up a prototype. It sits on the shelf for a while and sometimes I use it and sometimes I don’t, but it satisfies my curiosity.</p>

		<p class="question">You get to be picky and do four to six client projects a year, but you’ve got personal projects as well, such as Edits. Are there any other side projects on the horizon?</p>
        <p class="answer">I’m currently working on extending the Edits platform and I’m starting to open-source my personal projects. I’m excited to see where that goes! I also love vintage motorcycles and the idea of restoring and designing bikes. Recently, I found an old motorcycle to work on. This last month has just been crazy, but I’ve been working hard to try to learn to build a bike myself. It’s been a fun process to take the creative energy I have in the non-physical space and then try to see how I can translate that to something a lot more physical... and a lot more dangerous!</p>
