		<p class="question">You’ve been working with Dave Rupert and Reagan Ray as Paravel, Inc. for quite some time now. Were you design majors together at college?</p>
        <p class="answer">Dave, Reagan and I knew each other having grown up in Southeast Texas. We had known each other since high school and when we went off to college we remained good friends. Reagan earned an advertising degree from the University of Texas and did a lot of design work. Dave started in computer science, but majored in Japanese. After he graduated he spent three years in Japan teaching English. 
        <p class="answer">When I graduated I moved to Austin. This was in early 2000 and at that point I didn’t know much about how to code. Dave did, so I paid him eighty dollars — which was all I could afford — and asked him to teach me HTML. From very early on, Dave’s sort of been my mentor.
		<p class="question">What were you doing at this point? Were you making a living from web?
        <p class="answer">No, it was mainly just for fun. When he came back we immediately started doing a few jobs together, years before Paravel started. Reagan was designing for real estate development companies with a small company he started out of East Austin. Dave and I did a few sites together, which were small jobs.
		<p class="question">Was this just during evenings and weekends?
        <p class="answer">Yes. At the time I was working at an industrial contractor in the Houston area, building sites for them even though I didn’t know how to build anything well. I was self-taught and I knew enough to get by. The people I was working under were the marketing team, and they didn’t know about the web. I was sitting in a cubicle at the time, where they could see my screen, and I often had iChat open to get help with coding from friends. It almost felt like being under a microscope and I think they thought I was chatting!
        <p class="answer">At that time Dave and Reagan were working together in Phoenix. The real estate market was volatile and was coming to a halt. These guys deserved to be in control of their own destinies. We should be able to take jobs we want and we should be able to work for who we want and they should get paid on time, all the time. Eventually they quit and moved back to Austin and I immediately suggested that we work together. It was hard to begin with but I think it’s paid off.
		<p class="question">Because you’ve known these guys for so long, is there a level of comfort that you wouldn’t get with someone you know less well? And is it awkward being their boss?
        <p class="answer">It almost made it harder because we had to learn to be co-workers after being friends. You have to be polite. It’s hard to hire people who you also really care about on a personal level.

        <p class="answer">I’m a laid-back, casual person and I don’t pretend that I have answers. I want us to find them out together. We don’t have any financial help, we don’t have any investors, and we know there’s money coming in because we’re sending invoices out and doing hourly work. We all work on our own things at times, but they really seem to be in it for the long haul. I hope I’ll always remember how lucky I am to have such talented ￼￼￼people that really prop me up in a lot of ways. I’ve benefitted from their expertise, patience and feedback. I think even more than the long-term friendships, we made a commitment at the very beginning to stick it out. Now we’re in year four and maybe only in the past year we’ve really seen the pay-off for going through all the arguments and all of the rough times.
		<p class="question">So is Paravel now going to take the form of a three-way partnership of sorts?
        <p class="answer">The way we figured, to do a formal thirty-three percent ownership of the company would be really complicated tax-wise. We have an accountant, but I don’t want to hire anybody to do books and I don’t want to file a balance sheet every year. The situation is anything that we make over our salaries we will have an equal share of the profit.
		<p class="question">Do you have an hourly rate? Is that in place to accommodate working with clients? Or is it a way of working that you chose?
        <p class="answer">Early on we would bid a number and it would be a fixed amount; we’d always lose money, especially at the beginning. You can’t afford to not have good work to show if you want people to hire you, so we’d always do extra. We were really informal about things and we’d do a one-page proposal: phase one would be design planning, phase two would be the development and coding, and we’d have a testing phase. For example, a phase would be eighty to 220 hours. We’ll invoice for thirty or fifty percent up front so we invoice for the lower amount of the span. If we’re working along with the client and we start to get extra requests, before we’ve all agreed that this needs to happen it’s a way to bring up the budget again and it helps us to be really transparent about what we’re doing.

		<p class="question">So you’ll always have an idea of the project’s worth?
        <p class="answer">We feel that it’s a safe way of working; we don’t have overheads and we don’t have an office any more. We now meet at each other’s houses once or twice a week. We try to be very practical and very straightforward with how we charge. We pay for hosting, but we don’t really have overheads. It’s easy to forget how fortunate we are: if I put an hour in, every dollar that goes into that hour pretty much goes into a bank account. That’s amazing.
		<p class="question">As you don’t share an office, do you have check-ins in the morning to sum up what you’re all working on?
        <p class="answer">With iChat or Campfire it always lets you know who has ‘entered the room’, so we all show up at ‘the office’ at 9am. We talk all day long about every single thing we do. We decide almost everything together. It’s rare that thirty minutes go by where we haven’t discussed something.
￼￼￼

		<p class="question">As a company are you client-facing? Are your clients the type of clients that just meet for coffee?
        <p class="answer">It’s different every time. People ask about our process and I don’t even think we have one. It’s just about whatever the client needs. I usually do most of the Basecamp-ing, but even then that’s what we use Campfire for. Mostly at the beginning it was people who were in our hometown that I knew, so we would always meet up and have a talk. Now we don’t currently have any clients from Texas, but I don’t think the size of the client has changed. Usually we’re working with one or two people we like: smaller teams with smaller jobs. If the bigger job is CMS-intensive or e-commerce-intensive, we try to bring somebody else in to do that and we try to stick with what we love. If you do an e-commerce site and you do it well, but you don’t like the work it takes to do it, you’re going to get hired to do it again, and then your life is going to start to downgrade from your own perspective.
		<p class="question">Is there a chain reaction from doing something like a successful blog or a fun side project? Did you find that other designers and companies found your work, or was it a bit more organic?
        <p class="answer">As we weren’t selling all of our time, we decided to do stuff that we loved. We could afford to keep the ship afloat financially while we were doing it. We did some really silly stuff and we were hoping to have more time to get back to it. We would just do stuff that we liked. Dave and I really liked to test anything that was new from a CSS standpoint, so we wanted to make sure we weren’t putting out super-safe, super-straightforward, practical, compatible work all the time; i.e. the kind of stuff we got hired to do.
		<p class="question">A lot of the stuff you’ve created you’ve then given back to the community. You road-test things and everyone appreciates that.
        <p class="answer">For me that’s been ingrained into who I am. I didn’t go to school for this, so everything I’ve learned has been through the generosity of others. I remember coding sites back in Houston and looking at Dan Cederholm and Cameron Moll sharing their tips. I like that functionally — it has a great purpose and I think that it reinforces the desire to share. It creates a community aspect. I wouldn’t be able to do this if other people hadn’t written about it, so to me it’s just always been what you do. It’s a side- benefit when people see that and decide to hire us from it.
		<p class="question">You’re extremely well known for your experiments with responsive design.
        <p class="answer">This came about because of <a id="noterefTW001"></a><a href="#noteTW001" class="footnotelink">The Do Lectures site <b>1</b></a>. Our workflow had to change. My perception of the web was tied to Photoshop, pixels, and fixed widths. We’d put the whole responsive thing off, but essentially The Do Lectures paid us to learn responsive web design. I think we delivered a great site and product, and we’ll never forget that. Being thrown in at the deep end enabled us to fix our process around what we needed to be doing.
		<p class="question">The Do Lectures is based down in a little town in Wales. How did Jon Heslop come across you guys?
        <p class="answer">It was through the ‘Many Faces of...’ project. He sent me an email saying he really loved the Alan Rickman post and asked if we’d like to do a site for The Do Lectures. It was really exciting and we knew it would be a fun, wonderful job before we even started. They were patient and you could tell that they knew what they were doing just by the way they treated us. It was like they trusted us to do the best we could. When a client trusts you and tells you to go and do the best that you can, you get reverent and you feel that you’ve got to honour that with every hour, every minute, and with every brain cell you have. It’s always been nice when you get hired to do a job that you don’t know how to complete because that’s the only way we’ll be able to stay relevant. Technologies change and if you don’t keep learning, one day you’re going to be left behind. It’s cool when you can do it on the clock. A lot of this stuff we had to experiment with by ourselves in our own time, so when somebody hires you to do something you don’t know how to do, it’s double the value for a company.
		<p class="question">You were speaking about experimenting and pushing the boundaries — is that a natural curiosity, or do you get to a point where you think it must be possible, so you then try and solve the problem?
        <p class="answer">For me I’ve always seen ‘<q>building for the web</q>’ as ‘<q>here is my sandbox.</q>’ I think about what I want and I’m probably a constant pain in the arse because I know what we need to do but I have no idea how to do it. FitText was a good example. It’s not some- thing the web would die without or anything, but I loved it and I needed it for my blog. It’s always been a case of, ‘<q>What do we want? What do we need? Let’s figure it out.</q>’ As opposed to just taking in an assessment of what’s available and what’s broadly supported and just accepting that. No industry can do that. Any industry that progresses needs people who aren’t satisfied with what’s available.

        <p class="answer">I’ve always seen it that way and as far as arguing or commenting or debating go, I don’t want to get into any arguments or debates with anybody — I try to just keep it low-key. In the environment I grew up in, jobs were very physically dangerous. In a refinery, if you made a mistake, you could be incinerated or fall off a high building. So I take the web and what we do seriously because it has a huge impact — and it’s good that we get worked up about stuff because we’re passionate — but at the same time, we’re going to be okay. The worst-case scenario is that we might feel physically terrible, but we’ll still be alive and kicking. You’ve been staring at a screen for hours and it isn’t what our bodies were meant to do and you just want to collapse.
		<p class="question">You’ve written about this, haven’t you? About <a id="noterefTW002"></a><a href="#noteTW002" class="footnotelink">your own research <b>2</b></a> into your desks and sitting positions?
        <p class="answer">I wish I did what I said you should do more often! I have an adjustable-height desk and I stand and sit sometimes. I’ve designed myself into a hole; I’ve coded where I’ve taken a wrong turn and I did everything poorly, so I always try and make a conscious effort — whether I’m great at it or not — to change what my brain does and change my posture, not just for physical well-being, but to break up the day.
		<p class="question">Are you good at finishing at a set time and then leaving stuff alone?
        <p class="answer">I used to be terrible. I really noticed that I was a crappy husband. When you’re working from home it can be really difficult to let it go and just finish for the day. We moved into a new house and there you have to go around the garage to get to the office and it helps. And if you really want to stop working all the time, have a kid. You’ll have no choice!
        <p class="answer">Early on, I’d get so emotionally tied to a project and if something went bad, I’d just be sour all day and all evening. It still happens, but not as much, and honestly I think it’s probably because of parenthood. My son will be a year old in a week and a half. I’ve always noticed this with people who have kids — they don’t have time for shit. If they’re talking to you on the phone, it’s like, ‘<q>let’s make a decision because I’ve got other things to do,</q>’ and I’ve sort of become that. Whether I’ve been embarrassed about something that happened at work, or I’m not particularly pleased with the way an email was phrased to me, it doesn’t bother me as much. I’ve got more intense things going on in a really good way. Almost half of my hopes, expectations, and dreams have been scooped out of me and put into this little person.
		<p class="question">You’ve obviously got this kind of tight-knit, long-standing group of friends and collaborators who are part of the business. Do you ever talk about expanding, or do you want to keep it small?
        <p class="answer">We talk about it a lot and I don’t think we have very strong convictions. We’d have to be really thoughtful about adding a fourth person full-time. Imagine dealing with the three of us who have jokes from high school!
        <p class="answer">We always get excited when we get to work with someone else. We’ve been doing a site that sells fonts and it’s been very complicated from the e-commerce standpoint. We have some friends in Austin we’ve worked with and they’ve been fantastic. Anyone else with whom we work enhances our own perception of what we do. We get set in our ways and our processes, so when you bring someone in, it really helps us to refine and enhance what we do based on somebody else’s approach and perception.
