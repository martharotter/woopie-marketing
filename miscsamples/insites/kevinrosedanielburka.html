		<p class="question">How did you come to work together on Digg?</p>
		<p class="answer"><span class="person">K </span>I was in contact with someone at Mozilla and I was a fan of the design that was being done on mozilla.org. I wanted to know who had designed it and they pointed me in the direction of Silverorange, so I reached out to them. I explained the kind of project that I was working on and what I needed done, and that I had very little money. Initially they just connected me and Daniel up and I asked if he’d be available to do the design.</p>
        <p class="question">Was Digg live at this point?</p>
		<p class="answer"><span class="person">K </span>Yes, it had been live for a couple of months at least.</p>
		<p class="answer"><span class="person">D </span>But it was undesigned — it looked just like Delicious.</p>
		<p class="answer"><span class="person">K </span>Let’s just say it was very utilitarian. I’m not really a designer; I always look at myself as a product person, but I have an eye for design. Often when Daniel and I work together, he’ll ask me what I think, and either it’s awesome or I’ll ask for some tweaks and make some suggestions.</p>
		<p class="answer"><span class="person">D </span>You’re a good critical foil.</p>
		<p class="answer"><span class="person">K </span>Right. Then he’ll come back and we’ll tweak it and it’ll be even better. Someone once compared us to Batman and Robin, with me being Batman! <q>[laughs]</q></p>
        <p class="question">How did you feel when you TechCrunch put your heads on Batman and Robin?</p>
		<p class="answer"><span class="person">D </span>He liked it. I liked it less.</p>
		<p class="answer"><span class="person">K </span>I liked it just because he didn’t like it. I think it’s hilarious.</p>
        <p class="question">How soon did you realise that the two of you played so well off each other?</p>
		<p class="answer"><span class="person">K </span>I’d worked with a couple of designers in the past on various different projects that I was building. The most frustrating thing when you have an eye for design — but aren’t really a designer — is that it’s really hard to get across what you want.</p>
		<p class="answer">I remember the first time Daniel delivered some mockups for me for the second version of Digg, it was more than just design. It wasn’t like I would tell him what to do and he would just make it look pretty, he made suggestions like, ‘<q>I think that the number of Diggs should be highlighted and it should be the biggest thing on the page.</q>’ It was really cool because he took some initial ideas that I had and made them better than I’d originally thought. And I thought, ‘<q>wow, this is the kind of person I want to work with.</q>’</p>
        <p class="question">Daniel, did you feel comfortable enough being critical of the ideas that Kevin put forward?</p>
		<p class="answer"><span class="person">D </span>It took a little bit of an adjustment because originally it started as a normal client relationship. It was a strong enough agency that I was used to pushing back against clients — if they have a dumb idea, you can diplomatically tell them that it’s a dumb idea — but when you’re used to that kind of relationship, you’re less inclined to introduce new ideas. I remembering asking Kevin if he wanted me to tell him when I came up with ideas for his project.</p>
        <p class="question">When did you realise that you wanted Daniel to be part of Digg?</p>
		<p class="answer"><span class="person">K </span>I knew once I saw how much he was charging me and realised I could get it cheaper! No, it was really that I knew based on growth month-over-month that we were at the point where we were going to need someone on staff thinking about the next versions of Digg and where we wanted to take the product.</p>

		<p class="answer">We’d already worked well together and he was living in Toronto. I had a trip there for another reason, and we met up and started hanging out. I suggested that he come to San Francisco and hang out there, so I took him around and showed him all the cool spots and the cool coffee houses. I knew he was into biking so he saw the biking culture.</p>
		<p class="answer"><span class="person">D </span>It doesn’t take a lot to twist a geek’s arm to move to here!</p>
		<p class="answer"><span class="person">K </span>I knew he liked pouty indie girls and there are plenty of those in San Francisco.</p>
        <p class="question">How difficult was it transitioning from Silverorange?</p>
		<p class="answer"><span class="person">D </span>It worked really well. It was in the early days when I was working on just a bit of Digg’s stuff. Severing my ties completely would’ve been burning my bridges with Silverorange, and they’re good friends of mine, so I didn’t want to do that. But I’d also been working there for six and a half years, which is a long time when you’re in your mid-twenties.</p>
		<p class="answer">The opportunity with Digg was awesome because it was still so small and so flexible, and the other company I’d talked to was one of the giants around here. They weren’t flexible at all, whereas Kevin suggested that I move over, work three weeks a month on Digg, and still be somewhat involved with Silverorange. I kind of weaned myself off Silverorange, which worked out really well for all of us. I still have a great relationship with them and I’m going up there in a month to go to their yearly meeting.</p>
        <p class="question">Kevin, how did you both cope with having more people involved in the product? Did you still dictate the direction and the design of Digg?</p>
		<p class="answer"><span class="person">K </span>I think it was really difficult for me. One of the things that I found tough was that I didn’t really trust the Digg product in anyone else’s hands other than the two of us. Part of the reason why you join any company is that whether you’re answering the calls at the front desk or you’re coding the backend, you want to have your piece of the company, a bit that you’re responsible for. You want ownership of it.</p>
		<p class="answer">I think that one of the things that we’ve been very lucky with here at Milk is that everyone has a pretty good product compass. I feel that’s something that’s really important when you’re interviewing for certain people.</p>
		<p class="answer"><span class="person">D </span>I think everyone — even your finance guy — should have a good sense and appreciation for what the product is. This was a real struggle at somewhere like Digg; it was my first experience working for a fairly large company. It was around 100 people when I left, and the larger it got the more people you had with specific expertise. You end up with very siloed skills, and you end up in meetings where people are suggesting ideas that work perfectly for their group, but don’t work for the product as a whole. That is incredibly frustrating. You can end up with very myopic decision-making and a lot of confrontation.</p>

        <p class="question">When you started Pownce, was that a reaction to that situation? You just wanted to work on something smaller with less people involved?</p>
		<p class="answer"><span class="person">K </span>I felt that there were a lot of daily battles, and there were a lot of cooks in the kitchen. There were meetings with fifteen or twenty people arguing over things that two or three people should’ve been deciding. You’d go around in circles, over and over again.</p>
		<p class="answer">I was in a meeting where we were talking about adopting Google Apps as a business. I sat there listening to ops, the engineers, the CEO, and a handful of other people debating about whether this was a good idea. I looked at my clock and we were 45 minutes into this meeting. I rarely get upset, but I said, ‘<q>you guys, you’re killing the company. You know how long it would take a startup to make this decision? There, I just made it. It’s that easy, we’re doing Google Apps. Done!</q>’ I remember everyone just looking around the table like, ‘<q>you can’t make decisions like this.</q>’ The thing that’s tricky is you have to make sure the people you hire from enterprise backgrounds don’t bring a lot of that enterprise culture into your startup. I feel like that was often the case.</p>
		<p class="answer"><span class="person">D </span>From very early on there was a strong corporate feel at Digg, which was the antithesis of Digg. It’s this rebel tech site, but at the same time it was struggling with this very corporate feel. I think we learned a lot about culture. There were tons of lessons about building teams and efficiency, like hiring twice as many people does not double ones efficiency.</p>

        <p class="question">Starting Pownce was obviously a reaction to the culture at Digg, but was there a moment where you realised that Pownce wasn’t going to work as you hoped?</p>
		<p class="answer"><span class="person">K </span>I think it could have worked out. It was never like we were looking at it and thought that the service was dead. It had a loyal user base and we were getting tons of file transfers. Some of these services just need a little bit of time for the community to gel and grow. I truly believe it could have been big.</p>
        <p class="question">How did working on Pownce affect you both? Did it ever get tense?</p>
		<p class="answer"><span class="person">D </span>There were certainly some heated debates, but I don’t think we ever questioned the fundamentals of working together.</p>
		<p class="answer"><span class="person">K </span>No, I didn’t either. We both realised that we’d just bitten off a little more than we could handle at the time. It wasn’t like we were frustrated with our relationship; it was just that it was a lot to take on.</p>
        <p class="question">After Pownce, things changed for you both. Kevin, you refocused on Digg; Daniel, you made the move to Tiny Speck. Tell us a little about that time.</p>
		<p class="answer"><span class="person">D </span>We talked about something like Milk for a long time. We were talking about this part-way through Digg.</p>

		<p class="answer"><span class="person">K </span>But we weren’t really ready to do it. It felt like we were both frustrated at Digg, and I feel like we both burned out after spending that much time there. I knew Daniel was going to start looking for other work, and I knew we’d eventually work together in the future on something else.</p>
		<p class="answer"><span class="person">D </span>After I left Digg, we actually hung out more. We used to spend so much time at work in a high-tension situation. We didn’t hang out that much anymore because when we hung out we ended up talking about strategy. That sucks for friendship, so we actually hung out quite a bit more after I left Digg and that laid the groundwork for Milk, which was good.</p>
        <p class="question">It sounds like you were getting frustrated about the size, direction, and bureaucracy. Did you want to get back that startup culture and have control again?</p>
		<p class="answer"><span class="person">K </span>Yes, I think it feels good to get back to the size of Milk. When we sit down, we have two meetings a week and talk stuff out. Everyone has a pretty good product compass, and we figure out what to do next. We write it on the board and put numbers next to what we want to do next, and we go and do it. It’s easy. I love that lightweight, agile way of developing things. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t. Sometimes we come up with features we don’t like, and we’ll build them out and decide that we don’t like it, so we’ll throw it away; but it’s all very fluid.</p>
        <p class="question">You’ve come full circle, back to a small, agile team environment. Are you both buzzing with ideas again and getting stuff done?</p>
		<p class="answer"><span class="person">K </span>It’s difficult to not let one idea consume you. When we launched Oink, there were a thousand different fires in different areas and there are still bugs.</p>

		<p class="answer"><span class="person">D </span>There are things that we intentionally didn’t complete. Instead of launching in a year we launched when we did. Now we’re seeing how people use it and we really want to improve the features.</p>
		<p class="answer"><span class="person">K </span>I think eventually things will start to slow down a bit for us over the next couple of months and then we’ll begin rehashing some of our previous ideas, asking if they still make sense given the climate today. We’ll decide which one of these we want to pursue and go from there.</p>
		<p class="answer"><span class="person">D </span>I’ve talked to a few people recently about the labs model and they’ve all been really impressed with it. But it’s like giving Obama the peace prize his first year in office! I think this is a good idea, and I think it’s going to be awesome, but I’m not quite hubristic enough to think that this is the greatest idea ever. I’ll tell you if it was in a couple of years. Juggling two projects at a time is going to be hard, and getting any of these projects to be successful is going to be hard.</p>
        <p class="question">How important do you think being in San Francisco is to the potential success of a startup?</p>
		<p class="answer"><span class="person">K </span>I think the support network you get here is definitely an advantage. For example, MongoDB is what we’re on right now for Oink, and on Friday Jeff went down to the MongoDB conference and met with the people that created it. You can be in a cafe the next week and bump into Kevin from Instagram, or Ev from Twitter, you name it. Everyone is around here, so if you want to learn from others and build a network of people, being here will help you to do that.</p>

		<p><span class="person">D </span>That’s the nice thing, you don’t have to network, you can just make friends. We go out for wine and hang out with guys from Facebook, Twitter, and Google.</p>
		<p class="answer"><span class="person">K </span>That’s a great point: when you go to a conference, you’re there to network. Here, you’re at the rock-climbing gym and you bump into the guy who does all the scaling for Google. It’s not planned, you just go out and these kind of things happen.</p>
