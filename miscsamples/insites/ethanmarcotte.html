		<p class="question">How did you get started in the web industry?</p>
        <p class="answer">There weren’t really any digital design curriculums in the States when I was in college, so I was a literature major, but I’d always been interested in graphic design. I took some extra classes and got a not-so-legitimate copy of Photoshop in my first year.</p>
        <p>This was around 1995 or 1996 when a lot of people were getting into this internet thing professionally and I was feeling a little burnt-out from school. Originally I was going to get a PhD and teach, but I was feeling like I needed a break, so I guess I’m currently in year thirteen of ‘taking a couple of years off before graduate school.’ I got a random dotcom job in New York and then a studio job right after that, which was fantastic. I just fell in love with it.</p>
        <p>I think the first blog I started following was Scott Andrew Lepera. I was working at the studio at the time, doing interactive layouts, and he was one of the first people talking about DHTML. He was trying to explain a little of the actual magic behind it.</p>
        <p>Then I found Zeldman through him — there were three people blogging about web design at the time — so when I found Zeldman, that’s when I got interested in web standards. I started finding out about this CSS thing and it all went from there.</p>
		<p class="question">What kind of projects were you working on at the agency?</p>
		<p class="answer">I was Senior Developer at the time. It was highly compartment- alised. It was this long, beautiful galley office in SoHo. All the designers sat on one side and all the developers sat on the other side — it was like a viking ship office. It was just so weird that there was this physical division between the two groups. The projects we worked on were fun — big media companies like Nickelodeon and a lot of banks. Not the sexiest stuff, but fun.</p>

	<section class="content-block">
        <p>I left there in about 2001 and then went to Harvard for a fewyears to work. I went there because 2001 wasn’t a great time to be working in a digital agency: they were laying people off and I wanted something a bit more stable. I started working in the education section and eventually moved over to the group that builds a lot of Harvard courseware.</p>
        <p>I was design lead at the time, which was a lot of fun. It was very stable, but not great for my attention span, which is very short. I started freelancing and then eventually decided to go independent. About a year into being independent I met Greg Storey at South by Southwest and about a year after that we started collaborating on some stuff. It got to the point where most of my work was coming from Greg, so we decided to formalise things. I joined the team as an employee back in 2007 and worked with them for three years.</p>
		<p class="question">It was around this time that your fluid grids article appeared on A List Apart. Tell us a bit about how you came up with the idea.</p>
		<p class="answer">That was definitely a eureka moment. I was typesetting at three in the morning. I’d given up on the layout and I was like, ‘<q>I’m not going to worry about columns, I’ll just set all the type on this template.</q>’ I was just basically going over this proportional math — 16/13, 13/17, stuff like that — when I was like, ‘<q>maybe we can actually apply these modules to columns.</q>’ I don’t think I’ll ever have a moment like that ever again.</p>
		<p class="question">You followed that up in May 2010 with your game-changing ‘Responsive Web Design’ article. Tell us some of the background to the idea.</p>
		<p class="answer">Craig Hockenberry wrote <a id="noterefEM001"></a><a href="#noteEM001" class="footnotelink">a great article on ALA about having a separate style sheet with a media query in it <b>1</b></a>. I didn’t really know what a media query was at the time. They reminded me of print style sheets — you’ve got thirty-eight lines of code and override everything that isn’t necessary for a mobile user, and then you’ve add in some minor tweaks. I thought, ‘<q>why can’t we think flexibly across all these devices?</q>’</p>
		<p>I basically borrowed the term ‘responsive design’ from ‘responsive architecture.’ I think I’ve always been a fan of flexible layouts, but there needs to be more control just to make them appealing. We need to establish constraints to set type on small screens. Control following flexibility was a cool thing for me.</p>
		<p class="question">Do you think there’s ever a case for developing so-called ‘mobile only’ sites?</p>
		<p class="answer">I think so. It’s about the experience you want to put forth to users on a specific device. With The Boston Globe project, a lot of the conversations were about making a commitment to certain forms of content, irrespective of device. If somebody is on their laptop, on the train, or on their office network, they can still access everything.</p>
		<p class="question">How does it feel to be — if you’ll pardon the phrase — the poster boy for a new way of thinking?</p>
		<p class="answer">I feel like ‘responsive web design’ is a new name for a really old idea. It’s just that technology has now reached the point where we can actually act upon it. Media queries and flexible layouts allow us to do that.</p>
		<p class="question">Let’s talk a bit more about your work with The Boston Globe. Had the team made the decision to go down the responsive route or was persuading them part of your brief?</p>
		<p class="answer">A little of both. I was hired by the Filament Group, an interactive design firm in Boston who were the leads for the jQuery Mobile project. I’d known their work for a while and we’d hung out a couple of times. They finally contacted me in December last year and said they were going to be launching a site for The Globe.</p>

        <p>One of the first meetings I had with The Globe was with a bunch of senior VPs in a room to explain what responsive design was. I brought up Think Vitamin, Jon Hicks’ site, and showed them the original article, but at that point I hadn’t really designed a big responsive site myself. I had to explain to them why this was going to be important to them.</p>
        <p>Obviously, The Globe had a lot of challenges and a lot of unique needs, but showing them live sites really helped. Think Vitamin was actually one of the sites that did it, because it was a great example of an incredibly huge archive of content, made with some really thoughtful solutions and different break points. It was great — most of our design reviews with the client happened in tablets, phones and browsers. Once people see that, they can start a certain level of engagement with the content.</p>
		<p class="question">How do you go about making a newspaper responsive?</p>
		<p class="answer">That’s a fantastic question. When I came on in December or January, there had already been a lot of creative work done. They had a couple of their art directors; Miranda Mulligan was the Creative Director there, overseeing the whole process; they’d hired Upstatement; they’d also hired Filament to act on the design. They brought me in to help shape the process. It was basically about prototyping — and failing — as quickly as possible in CSS and then refining things visually as much as we could.</p>
		<p class="question">What’s fascinating you at the moment? Where do you go next?</p>
		<p class="answer">In the short-term, I’m working with Erin Kissane and Krista Stevens — they’re doing a new magazine about content strategy, online. It’s been fun just to get back into Photoshop. Next year I’ve got a lot of speaking, so I’ve got to think of something intelligent to say.</p>
        <p>I’m kind of excited about some of the stuff that people are trying to improve on — what we can do with a responsive framework as well as some cool CSS3 stuff coming around in the form of FlexBox. I’m really excited about it all.</p>
