		<p class="question">Is your background in design or illustration?</p>
        <p class="answer">My background was in illustration. When I left school I was the only one in my class who went to art college. I went to do a ‘technical illustration’ course, which was predominantly drawing exploded gear boxes. It wasn’t quite what I wanted to do, but I had to do the course to get to be where I wanted to be. It mainly involved illustration, but also taught basic typography and graphic design. Halfway through the year students were split into those who were led more by graphic design and those who were led more by illustration.</p>
        <p class="answer">I stayed with illustration. Towards the end of the second year I had to make a decision on what to do next. I didn’t want to do engine diagrams or airbrushing forever, so I thought long and hard about where my passion lay and what I really wanted to do. Eventually I decided on natural history illustration and the only place I could do that was Blackpool College. Although I hated living in Blackpool, the college was great and for my middle year they sent me to a workplace in the Lake District. I worked for the national park there for a year, which was sublime — I didn’t want to come back after that! I spent that year working on the shores of Lake Windermere in a place called Brockhole, which is a large old Victorian house.</p>
        <p class="answer">When I finished my course I decided that I was going to be a natural history illustrator and I approached various publishers and magazines. The problem was that the UK has enough natural history artists; they just don’t need any more. Secondly, illustration was — and still is — a poorly-paid profession. I did a couple of commissions, but soon after that I found a junior designer job in Coventry for the council. I’d been promised big illustration jobs for Oxford University Press’ bird guides that were due to come out in four years, but I needed work sooner.</p>

		<p class="question">And later you worked at a publishing company in Oxford? Was it doing illustration or graphic design?</p>
        <p class="answer">It was mainly project management, but also included design. I did as much as I could: cover design, layout design, typesetting, that kind of thing. But it became increasingly managerial and I was trying to stay within creative work, so I left. It was also partly because my daughter had just been born and it was a way of having at least one day a week that I could dedicate to her: for the first five years I didn’t work on a Friday. The reality tended to be that I then worked all weekend, but at least there was one day in the whole week where it was just the two of us, or three of us once my son was born.</p>
        <p class="answer">Another reason for my leaving was that the web was an exciting, new medium that I wanted to work in. I wanted to explore it and I knew I wasn’t going to get the chance to do that working with the publisher.</p>
		<p class="question">What made you want to try building websites?</p>
        <p class="answer">When I went freelance and started working on the web, web standards was a new thing. I read Jeffrey Zeldman’s book and that was the key trigger. It was a time of discovery, realising what you could do with CSS. I enjoyed the creative challenges it brought with it, trying new things to see if I could make it work. It was the time of the CSS Zen Garden, which felt like a rite of passage; to be accepted into this little world you had to submit something, and that in itself was a big experience. I really enjoyed the process of discovering new ways of doing things and blogging about that. The thing about print design is that if you have an idea, you can’t get it out quickly; with a website, you can publish it and then you can update it. A lot that happened in those early days was that you’d blog about a certain CSS technique, someone would improve upon it, then someone else would improve upon that, and you’d have a conversation going on between blogs and comments. Within the same day, you could update it and say, ‘<q>scrap that — this is a better way of doing it. It’s only two lines and it’s much simpler.</q>’ It was very exciting.</p>
		<p class="question">When you went freelance, did you envisage it being illustration work or web work? Did you have clients lined up, or was it a big leap of faith?</p>
        <p class="answer">There was one point where it seemed like a leap of faith, but by the time it actually happened I had enough work lined up. I had work from the publisher I was working for originally, and from a local charity. I didn’t have any web projects lined up, but one fell into my lap within a couple of months, working with a design studio on a project funded by Barclays called ‘u-project’. I’d never done a job like it before and I was physically sick! But it was good because I leaped into the deep end and learned along the way. That job then led to other web projects and slowly but surely, the print design work dwindled and the web work kept growing. For a long time websites were the main thing that Hicksdesign did.</p>
￼￼
		<p class="question">When did icon design enter the fold? It’s an interesting area of design, because in many ways it’s completely married to the web world, but in terms of the physical process of creating an icon, it’s much closer to illustration.</p>
        <p class="answer">That was what was so nice about it. Back in 2003 I’d been freelancing for a year and a half and the Mac browser scene was starting to grow — you had the choice of Internet Explorer or Netscape! But suddenly Safari Beta was released for Mac and all these other browsers started coming out of the woodwork, like Camino.</p>

        <p class="answer">Camino was great because it was a really lightweight, fast browser. I liked the way it worked, but wasn’t that keen on its icon, so I did a few toolbar icons and an application icon. That got noticed by a guy called Stephen Garrity, who was putting together designers to work for Firefox, which at the time was called ‘Phoenix’ and then later ‘Firebird’. The decision was made to change the name to Firefox and it was during the Christmas of 2003 that I started working on the Firefox icon. It was a little volunteer project before version 0.8 came out, so it was really early days and for a very niche audience.</p>
        <p class="answer">It was released around February 2004 and it became huge. It was the standards champion to fight against Internet Explorer. For me it now doesn’t feel like something I was ever involved with as it’s since been changed by other people, but back then it was great. It was the start of my work in icon design.</p>
        <p class="answer">The previous year — when Zeldman first linked to me after I redesigned my site using web standards — there was a big spike of interest. When Firefox happened, it was immense.</p>
        <p class="answer">I didn’t really think about icon design until Firefox, then from that point on it became something that I enjoyed, especially as I was using some of the skills I’d learned in college.</p>
		<p class="question">How do you balance work with your personal life? Do you find that work creeps into your evenings and weekends?</p>
        <p class="answer">Yes. I don’t see a way of avoiding it. I think that’s one advantage of having a studio: there’s the flexibility of leaving work at five and going home to have tea with my kids, do bedtime stories, and that sort of thing. Some people would be leaving at six-thirty and getting home for the end of that. I can move the hours I have to work to later on in the evening, so it’s not that it’s extra work.</p>

        <p class="answer">It took me years to realise that you can just let work fill up your free time if you let it. Do you spend all weekend working, or do you leave it until next week? Cameron Moll said, ‘<q>don’t promise the client it’ll be ready on Monday because that means working over the weekend to get it to them. Instead say Wednesday to make sure that you’re leaving enough time.</q>’ I think success helps with that to a degree. In the early days I had to meet deadlines earlier because I was eager to impress and keep clients, whereas now I feel confident that the work will come in, and with that confidence I can give clients a more realistic deadline date.</p>
        <p class="answer">At the moment I’m doing some work for Opera again. They’re great to work with because they give you time and space to go away and think. That’s often a problem: client budgets don’t often allow you time to sit down and think through a problem.</p>
		<p class="question">Have you changed to project-based pricing?</p>
        <p class="answer">I’ve recently done a job where for the first time I overestimated it and I actually came in under the estimate. When I first started I weighed up the cost of consumables such as printer ink and paper, which now just doesn’t come into it. These days I try to work out how many weeks in a year I need to work and for how many days, allowing time off for work and holidays, sickness, and that kind of thing. From that point, I’ve added a little bit every year or so with inflation. I still don’t know whether I’m under- or over-charging compared to everyone else!</p>
        <p class="answer">With the work I’m currently doing for Opera, rather than having a certain project in mind, it can change throughout the week. They have a certain amount of my time each month, and it’s up to them how they want to use it.</p>
		<p class="question">A few years ago you decided to take a full-time gig with Opera after years of freelancing. What was the motivation behind that move?</p>
        <p class="answer">Part of it was regular income. When you have a family, that’s always nice to have. The money does come in with freelance work, but it’s very hard to know just when that will be. I also wanted to work in a team. I enjoy working by myself, but I’d come to a point where I wanted to work on something a bit bigger than just my own small projects.</p>
        <p class="answer">Working for a browser also appealed to me. I hadn’t decided that I would work for them until I went there for the interview. I had a lovely couple of days in Oslo and met some really nice people. They had a nice attitude and I thought, ‘<q>why not?</q>’ Just for a chance to do something different.</p>
		<p class="question">You said that working in a team was one of your motivations. As you’re based in the UK and they’re based in Norway, how did the team element come into play?</p>
        <p class="answer">It was hard to work remotely, but not impossible. Skype is a wonderful thing for connecting remote workers together, but ultimately I felt they needed someone in-house to do the role effectively. I think that’s one of the reasons why I left in the end. I was also a little concerned that I had been out of the market for too long.</p>
        <p class="answer">After I left, projects came back in and I worked for Shopify, Jolicloud, and WooThemes. It was great. It felt like anything could still happen, that I could still do it. However I always left the door open for Opera if the opportunity came about to work on future projects with them, which is what I’m doing now.</p>
		<p class="question">How did the book come about? Writing a book is obviously such a different process from doing design work. Was it a long, arduous process at all?</p>
        <p class="answer">Yes, it was! I had the idea six years ago. I was looking for a book on icon design and there wasn’t one. I talked to Josh Williams about it and he had a similar idea at the time. I thought, ‘<q>oh well, if Josh is going to do it then I’ll just stay out of it.</q>’ His idea never came to be. Later on, I talked to APress, who were interested in the idea. I could see the quality of books that they were producing, which wasn’t bad, but I wanted to try to get as much of a coffee table book feel as I could. I talked to Mark Boulton about the idea, who said, ‘<q>let’s do it,</q>’ and they got it organised.</p>

        <p class="answer">A couple of years ago we had our preliminary meeting in Cardiff. I came away from the meeting feeling really excited that the right team was going to be involved and it could actually happen. Right from the first meeting, we talked about having a square book: something that would suit the icon format. If I had decided to self-publish it never would’ve materialised. Without having other people putting money into it and hiring people to project- manage and chase me, I wouldn’t have written it. I think the longest thing I’d ever written before that point was 4000 words for a .Net article, and that was hell! The book was many times that. It was my first and probably my last time! I’m hoping for the opportunity to write a second edition, but I certainly wouldn’t start writing a book again from scratch, because it took all of last year. In reality I would’ve liked to have another six months to add a few more things and make it even more definitive, but I suppose you always feel that way when you write a book.</p>
		<p class="question">What’s your idea of a dream gig? Is there something you’d love to get your hands on?</p>
        <p class="answer">It wouldn’t be Apple because they don’t need designers. They’ve obviously got good people doing good work, and it feels like somewhere that you couldn’t make a difference. A few years ago my dream gig was a Mac browser called OmniWeb. It was great at the time and I really wanted to design the icons for it. We talked about it, but it never came to be.</p>
        <p class="answer">My dream job now? I guess it would have to be something involving cycling! I saw a job ad for Trek in the States, which included job perks like being able to use their track facilities and bikes. That would be great! But I’m going to say working for Rapha — or a British bike company like Enigma or Genesis — would be my dream job.</p>
