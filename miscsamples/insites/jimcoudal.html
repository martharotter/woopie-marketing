		<p class="question">We recently watched the talk you gave at the inaugural Chicago CreativeMornings. It was very inspiring to hear how Coudal Partners came into being and learn about your journey.</p>
        <p class="answer">The story I told there wasn’t really me trying to say, ‘<q>look at all the cool stuff we did;</q>’ it was more about how being open to chance and serendipity can open up opportunities for you, and that it’s easy to be stuck in a place and not see where you can go from there.</p>
        <p class="answer">How Coudal Partners came into existence is an unusual and unique story. I was creative director at a mid-sized Chicago ad agency for three to four years, and was doing good work for a couple of clients and mediocre work for the rest of them. I was unsatisfied, not necessarily with my position, but with the fact that I was producing some work that I was not particularly proud of. Like I said in the CreativeMornings talk, I was doing work I wasn’t proud of for people I didn’t like.</p>
        <p class="answer">An opportunity came up through one of my clients, the White Sox — one of the professional baseball teams in Chicago. For reasons completely unrelated to creative, we had a couple of years of successful advertising and won a bunch of awards, and the more freedom the client gave us creatively, the more attention the advertising got, so it was a really good relationship from a creative standpoint. Then the client canned the agency for financial reasons. Like so many other creative directors and account managers at ad agencies, I figured that was my moment to go to the client and say, ‘<q>I know you’re canning the agency, but if I start an agency, can I have the business?</q>’ And they said yes!</p>
        <p class="answer">At that point it was just me, but I quickly hired Kevin Guilfoile and we had a pretty good run. We got a lot of attention for the work we did in sports, so that just created other work from other sports teams and sports broadcasters, which led to entertainment work. We then brought in another partner, Susan Everett — who is a brilliant identity designer — and then we started to get work for restaurant groups and financial service companies, and the next thing you know, we were a design and advertising consultancy.</p>

		<p class="question">Were you involved in web projects at this time or was it more print-based work?</p>
        <p class="answer">No, we did lots of television work. There wasn’t any real ‘web’ to speak of then: this was around 1996, so lots of film, lots of television commercials, outdoor billboards, magazine ads, and radio commercials.</p>
        <p class="answer">We also began to be get well known for naming things. People would come to us and say, ‘<q>we have this new concept for a national restaurant brand and we don’t know what to call it.</q>’ That was actually as much fun as any client assignment we ever had, because it’s just arguing. And we love to argue!</p>
        <p class="answer">We didn’t have any clear idea; we just kept growing and got more business and did good work — occasionally great work — and then 9/11 happened and the American economy went in the shitter. The first thing that companies cut when they’re in financial straits are consultant services: more ￼specifically, advertising and media spending. If you cut those costs you don’t have to fire anyone except the agency.</p>

        <p class="answer">We lost a couple of accounts, but again, it had nothing to do with the work we were doing. At that point, we had to make a decision. I think the bad luck we had was a blessing, because if we hadn’t had to look at what we were doing and decide where to go, we probably would have just kept growing without thinking about anything and then probably be miserable running a big agency.</p>
        <p class="answer">By 2000 we had already started coudal.com and it was a pretty uncrowded field in terms of people who were blogging. I don’t even think they called it blogging at that time, but we were doing it, Zeldman was doing it, and our friends at 37Signals were doing it.</p>
        <p class="answer">Because we were dedicated to it and we didn’t really have any web work from clients, we just made a site for ourselves as a sort of a sandbox where we could mess around with things, and the site got popular. We started <a id="noterefJC001"></a><a href="#noteJC001" class="footnotelink">Photoshop Tennis <b>1</b></a> and that exploded, so as we were losing business, we also had this popular and growing web presence that didn’t pay us anything, but was extremely satisfying.</p>
        <p class="answer">We decided either we were going to chase after more clients whose work we didn’t really want to do, or we could find another way. Given we had an audience — not a huge audience, but thousands of people every day — we thought maybe we could find a way to turn some of the things we’d like to do into the things that help pay the bills. Our plan was that we were going to work hard and be curious and learn new things and be meticulous about the products and the way we communicate... and hopefully good things will happen.</p>
		<p class="question">You mentioned that, ‘work begets work,’ at CreativeMornings. The more work you get, the more people you need to hire,￼but after a point you’re simply taking on work that doesn’t excite you just to pay the wage bill. How do you grow, but keep yourself interested?</p>
        <p class="answer">I think we’ve grown, but we grew smaller. We’d all worked in bigger companies and we’d started to see the sort of political ugliness that comes from them. Creative people are very territorial, so if you have a lot of them, they can’t all be happy. If somebody needs to get the good assignment, somebody needs to get the shit assignment. There’s no way around it.</p>
        <p class="answer">But as we started working more on things that we could make the decisions about — as opposed to outside forces that could make the decisions for us — we decided that we would grow the businesses organically and be careful about growing the staff as well. We wanted to be happy creatively, and certainly we wanted to be happy financially — we all have kids and mortgages and pay tuition for schools — but it felt like, ‘<q>do what you love and the money will take care of itself.</q>’ It’s a cliché because it’s true.</p>
        <p class="answer">I think it’s important to have a real connection to the actual work, so if that means we don’t grow 1000 percent a year and we’ll never have an IPO, so be it. I think we’ve been in a situation where we’ve chased the money; the money was good, but we weren’t happy. I figured, ‘<q>let’s try something else. Let’s chase the happiness and see if we can make the money doing it.</q>’</p>
		<p class="question">That’s really interesting because it’s the polar opposite to the way we’re conditioned to think about business.</p>
        <p class="answer">I see it, too. I think it’s interesting because in 2006, Jason Fried of 37Signals and I did the keynote at SXSW Interactive. We both talked a little bit about making things for yourself and other people who are like you will want them. The phone call I get most of all is, ‘<q>how can I hire a good web developer?</q>’ My answer is, ‘<q>you can’t because they’re all working for themselves.</q>’ Ones who are available are — generally speaking — in the second tier.</p>
		<p class="question">Moving on to Field Notes, were you taken aback by the initial success of the product?</p>
        <p class="answer">We’ve been doing it for almost four years and it’s been growing steadily. We always had confidence in it. I think the breakthrough for Field Notes was the idea to offer subscriptions and the quarterly limited edition packs. I think the product is great and I knew the minute I saw it that it would sell. The first day they were available for sale we had thirteen orders. I knew the product itself was good, but I think the thing that gave us the leg up — or at least gave us the opportunity to grow and be successful — was this idea of these limited editions.</p>

		<!-- END a Pullquote figure //-->

        <p class="answer">First of all, the limited edition Field Notes give us four awesome projects to work on every year, but also they sell out quickly, so people want to subscribe, and that gives us a little bit of a cushion in terms of cash flow, as people are actually paying us ahead of time for future editions.</p>
        <p class="answer">Most importantly, it gives us a really solid and authentic reason to talk to our customers four times a year. We don’t have to send our mail saying, ‘<q>today only, free shipping!</q>’ We send them mail that says, ‘<q>the spring edition is this and you have first crack at it before it goes public.</q>’</p>
        <p class="answer">We’re proud of a lot of our statistics, but probably the one we’re most proud of is that nobody quits our mailing list. We send tens of thousands of emails every time there’s a new edition and we get thirty people quitting the list. That’s amazing.</p>
        <p class="answer">I think that’s because we’ve been straight-up and honest with our audience and we have actual news to tell them, as opposed to just marketing. It’s pretty successful now — we’re in almost 500 stores, we make a lot of sales online, and we’ve got a lot of subscribers.</p>
        <p class="answer">We made money every year, but we barely made money in the first year and we made a bit of money in the second year. The same with The Deck, actually — both are growing.</p>
		<p class="question">How did The Deck come about? Are we right in thinking it was initially for advertising your own products?</p>
        <p class="answer">It was. I was looking for a way to advertise a previous product of ours — which is still in business, actually — called Jewelboxing. There weren’t really any great options for reaching what we now call, ‘the web design and creative community’ so we thought, ‘<q>here’s an opportunity.</q>’ We also thought that online advertising was going in a really bad direction — and it still is, with these big ads that take over the page and block content.</p>

					<p>We’ve never made a PDF, we’ve never made a presentation of any kind with a chart in it, we’ve never gone to a sales call, and we’ve never taken a potential customer out for a drink. The dirty little secret of The Deck is that it works.</p>

        <p class="answer">We came up with this idea for The Deck and got our friends Jeffrey Zeldman and Jason Fried from 37 Signals to throw in with us and start a small network to display advertising. We wouldn’t take an ad from a product that we didn’t respect, we’d only show a single small ad on any page view, and we’d be fair in the way that we’d compensate the publishers.</p>
        <p class="answer">We started with only three properties in The Deck and now there are over fifty. We’re serving up 100 million ads a month and it’s going crazy. We’ve never made a PDF, we’ve never made a presentation of any kind with a chart in it, we’ve never gone to a sales call, and we’ve never taken a potential customer out for a drink. The dirty little secret of The Deck is that it works. For the right advertiser, it’s an efficient and effective way to get the message out, although it doesn’t work for everybody.</p>
		<p class="question">Does The Deck allow you the freedom to pursue other projects ?</p>
        <p class="answer">Yeah, I guess so. It’s not just us, it gives a lot of people in The Deck the freedom to try out more stuff. It’s not that we’re getting away with anything; it’s working for the advertisers, too. I worry that our own projects are getting so big that all of a sudden we’re out of time to do the next thing. We’re going to come to a point fairly soon where we’re going to have to do something. I don’t know what that’s going to be, but there are other things we’re messing with.</p>
		<p class="question">Do you find that people who visit coudal.com for one reason — for example a link from a newsletter — will end up buying a notebook, or placing an ad?</p>
        <p class="answer">Anybody who comes to coudal.com in any way is a good thing for us. We feel that if people come to Coudal, they’ll see what we’re about and some of them will eventually wind up buying a Field Notes pack, or will see The Deck ad and tell their marketing department about it. We don’t count things and we don’t plot data and traffic, but we just feel that the people who visit coudal.com every day must be like us in some way, because why would they read our ridiculous things if they weren’t on some level like us?</p>
        <p class="answer">We devote a lot of time to seemingly unproductive things. On our front page, that little column, right in the middle of the page called ‘Fresh Signals’ — it’s updated thirty times a day with interesting links. Someone once said, ‘<q>that’s the spine of the whole thing.</q>’ That little row of quick paragraphs linking us to other places in the world is sort of the beating heart of all the rest of it. We’re there every day, so if you’re at work and you’re a fan of ours or you appreciate the kind of things we do, then you’re part of it in one way or another, and eventually you’re going to buy Field Notes or a Deck ad or do something else with us.</p>
		<p class="question">Beyond talking about individual projects, what kind of advice could you offer people wanting to make the move from clients to customers?</p>
        <p class="answer">Everybody says, ‘<q>I should have done this sooner.</q>’ It’s no coincidence that every person I know who went from working for clients to working for themselves is happier. One thing I say is, ‘whatever you do, don’t talk your idea to death.’ Ideas take the path of least resistance. Frequently that means, ‘<q>we’ll figure out a way why we cannot do it,</q>’ but our way is, <q>‘let’s do it and if it doesn’t work, fine, we’ll go onto something else.’</q></p>
        <p class="answer">It’s so easy to talk yourself out of a good idea that you have to be constantly on guard against that. I’ve seen it happen so many times — we even do it ourselves. Saying no is really easy and powerful, because when you say, ‘<q>I don’t think we can do that,</q>’ not only do you kill the idea, but you also save yourself a lot of work. If you’re open to opportunities and willing to take a chance on the ones that catch your fancy, once in a while, things are going to work. When they don’t work, that’s constructive, too. I think chance and serendipity have played a big role in our development of whatever company we are, and we respect that.</p>
        <p class="answer">In the design process itself, find me a designer who doesn’t love the phrase ‘happy accident’. You’re doing a layout and you’ve got it sketched out, you know exactly what you’re going to do and you screw something up royally and you look at it, and you’re like, ‘<q>oh shit, there’s an idea.</q>’</p>
        <p class="answer">I think that that’s applicable not only to the creative process, but also to the business process. Sometimes the only way to see the way forward is to move sideways and sometimes we move sideways completely by accident — you’ve got to be open to it. Find me somebody who knew what they were going to build when they started to built it. I’d like to talk to that person.</p>
        <p class="answer">Josh Williams, who built Gowalla, said, ‘<q>you need to get the ship out of the harbour before you can turn it.</q>’ If you’re sitting in the dock, you can’t turn it, but once you’re moving, no matter how big the ship is, you can turn it. I thought that was an interesting metaphor. You can’t really see where you’re going until you start.</p>
