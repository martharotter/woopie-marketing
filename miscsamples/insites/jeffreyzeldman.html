		<p class="question">You started out in advertising. How did you move from Madison Avenue to Happy Cog?</p>
        <p class="answer">I failed at several things first. I was a musician — I played with a post-punk, techno-surf band called The Inside Surfers that was popular in DC in the mid-80s. I was also a composer and really liked creating music, but I didn’t know how to market it, schmooze, or put myself forward.</p>
        <p class="answer">I wasn’t really making a living from that and I ended up in advertising. I went in thinking I was going to make short films and posters. I thought I would make really funny, artistic little movies and beautiful posters, and somehow that would sell the client’s product and everybody would be happy. What I actually got was an education in print and client services.</p>
        <p class="answer">I learned about meeting with clients, listening to them, being their partner, not having a pretentious attitude about what you do, not having an ‘us-versus-them’ attitude — because that doesn’t work. There was cliquishness in advertising and I thought if I ever had a career, I didn’t want to be cliquish like that and I hope I’m not.</p>
        <p class="answer">I ended up freelancing at a very hip ad agency. By great luck, Warner Bros. got in touch and said, ‘<q>this Batman Forever movie is coming out and we really want a website — do you guys know how to do that?</q>’ The agency lied and said, ‘<q>of course, we’ve been doing websites.</q>’</p>
        <p class="answer">I partnered up with Steve McCarron and Alec Pollak. We locked ourselves in Steve’s room and we worked on this website for three months. It was a huge success. This was 1995 and there was nothing like it on the web. We even had people try to tell us how to make websites and we ignored them, because that would have made a conventional, shitty website.</p>
        <p class="answer">To get the account we had a bit of a shoot-out with the internal team at Warner Bros. They were making this big presentation and they said, ‘<q>Batman’s gonna fly out and he’s going to say, “Hello, I’m Batman!”</q>’ and I just blurted out, ‘<q>Batman doesn’t talk.</q>’ Now, that was rude — I shouldn’t have done that as a competitor was presenting; I should have kept my mouth shut. But I love Batman, this was bullshit, and I wasn’t going to stand for it. I felt they were hurting the brand.</p>

					<p>If you’ve got someone like Jason Santa Maria working for you, you don’t need to breathe down his neck and tell him how to design a page. I think a lot of it for me is just finding people who are better than me at everything that I do and then delegating to them.</p>

        <p class="answer">The client looked me dead in the eye and I knew we had the gig. Through my career I’ve always made a point of connecting psychologically with the client. You can’t sell work if you don’t understand who you’re dealing with. You definitely have to understand the user — that’s really important and ultimately who you’re designing for — but you have to understand the person who’s standing between you and the user, too.</p>
        <p class="answer">There were three million people using the web in 1995 and one-and-a-half million people visited Batman Forever. I’d failed at all these other careers — I’d also been a journalist and I’d written novels that didn’t get published and I’d done lots of things that didn’t succeed, so I thought, ‘<q>oh my god, here’s an audience</q>’. I left advertising and I became a web designer — that’s all I wanted to do.</p>
        <p class="answer">I started a personal site and I started teaching immediately. I wrote a book called ‘Ask Doctor Web’ — a free, online book. It sucked and half the advice was wrong, but all the advice that people were getting at the time was kind of messed up. I wasn’t trying to set myself up as an expert; I was just really enthusiastic about HTML. I thought, ‘<q>everyone’s going to be a writer now, everyone’s going to be an artist, everyone’s going to publish. HTML is so easy to learn, everyone’s going to do design.</q>’ I saw this arts and crafts creative flowering happening in my head in 1995.</p>
		<p class="question">An almost polar opposite to your experiences in advertising, which sound very corporate and stuffy!</p>
        <p class="answer">The ultimate advertising product wasn’t corporate and stuffy, but the meetings around it and the process were. If they had an upper-middle manager, we had an upper- middle manager. If they had a guy who blew his nose into a Kleenex, we had a guy who blew his nose into a Kleenex.</p>
        <p class="answer">I worked at a place for a guy named Sal DeVito — we sold this amazing campaign to VH1. It was a brilliant campaign and it would have made my career. The client said, ‘<q>I really love it, but could I just see a different font?</q>’ And Sal said, ‘<q>no, this meeting is over.</q>’ He got up and we left and that was it — and my career was over. Just because he wasn’t willing to show them a different font. Sal is a genius with a track record miles long. He can do whatever he wants and he doesn’t need my permission. But at that moment, losing VH1 over a font, I knew that if I ever got to be a creative director, I was going to be more diplomatic. It’s not that I don’t believe in our ideas. It’s that I know there’s always another good idea — and the next good idea might even come from the client.</p>
		<p class="question">You’ve been blogging for many years. What keeps you motivated to keep writing and sharing?</p>
        <p class="answer">Whenever I speak and people say to me, ‘<q>my career’s kind of stuck,</q>’ I always telling them, ‘<q>start a blog.</q>’ I learn by reading other people and I still learn every day by looking at websites and going, ‘<q>oh, wow, why didn’t I think of that? That’s really smart.</q>’</p>
        <p class="answer">I think we have an obligation to pass along this knowledge. If you work in a pastry shop, it would be a pity to not try a pastry, and if you work in this medium that’s democratic and worldwide and instantaneous and there are lots of other creative people from all walks of life, who all have ideas and are all contributing to it, it would be a pity not to share your ideas.</p>
		<p class="question">Tell us about how A List Apart started. Was it a natural progression from Ask Doctor Web?</p>
        <p class="answer">At the time there was a great mailing list called ‘webdesign-L’ that a guy named Steve Champion was running, and I really wanted to do one. There were some really popular lists in 1996 in New York, but I couldn’t read them because there were a lot of egomaniacs on those lists who expended great energy dissing one another. Those comment wars would sidetrack and derail the conversation that the mailing list was actually trying to foster.</p>

        <p class="answer">A guy named Brian Platz and I came up with a list where everyone could send in what they were thinking about and we would curate and edit it. And, once a day, you’d get it. It was like a daily newspaper on web design, written by its users. By editing and curating we could give shape to the content and make sure there was good behaviour. If someone was deliberately trying to put someone else down, we wouldn’t have to publish that. There were plenty of other places to be a troll and that’s why we called it ‘A List Apart’. Eventually the website more or less took over.</p>
        <p class="answer">At Happy Cog the client services work finances products like A List Apart, so we never need to involve investors. I always wanted to make products that I thought were cool, like Foursquare, because I love that stuff. I wish I could come up with things like that, but I don’t. Everything that I come up with is content-based and labour-intensive. Eric Meyer and I created An Event Apart, but it means that we work on it every day.</p>
		<p class="question">You’ve always been very generous in your support and praise of your colleagues, both in Happy Cog and in the wider industry.</p>
        <p class="answer">Promoting other people, mentoring other people, giving knowledge away — there’s a payback to it, but you don’t do it for that reason. There is karma and if you don’t promote and support the people who work for you, they’re going to hate you and leave. I worked in places where people would say, ‘<q>Jeffrey Zeldman and his partner did this, it was a really great campaign,</q>’ and I worked in other places that didn’t do that. I would leave those places as soon as I could.</p>

		<p class="question">What’s your management style?</p>
        <p class="answer">I don’t micro-manage. If you’ve got someone like Jason Santa Maria working for you, you don’t need to breathe down his neck and tell him how to design a page. I think a lot of it for me is just finding people who are better than ￼me at everything that I do, and then delegating to them.</p>
        <p class="answer">Greg Hoy runs the East Coast office of Happy Cog. He’s better at that than me. I get better project managers, better designers, better coders, and just step back. Although I miss all the hands- on work, I now have the freedom to create a book series or I now have the freedom to start some other business.</p>
		<p class="question">A lot of people in our industry are trying to move away from client services to products. You seem very happy to have a foot in both camps.</p>
        <p class="answer">I am happy and it’s nothing new for us. We’ve always published a magazine and we’ve always done client work. Happy Cog started as just me and I used to hire people as I needed them. Now we have studios in Austin, Philadelphia, and New York.</p>
        <p class="answer">On a day-to-day basis, I’m far less hands-on in client services than I used to be. Once I wire-framed, designed, and coded everything, sold it to the client, and made breakfast. Now I’m a chairman, and I have people for that. I feel a bit like Walt Disney, although without his talent.</p>

        <p class="answer">Right now I’m more interested in content. I spend a lot of time on our book series, a lot of time picking people for An Event Apart, planning the playlist of human beings that goes on stage. We went through a period a couple of years ago where we’d put the same people on at every show, so we’d have a roadshow. Now we’re mixing it up again so every show is different — we’re bring- ing in people from all over. There are a million details on that: there are a million details on the books, there are a million details on the magazines. Then we have Cognition — the Happy Cog blog — which is taking on a life of its own. And I’m thinking about films a little bit. There’s a lot going on.</p>
        <p class="answer">There are only two things that keep me sane right now because I can’t drink, I don’t smoke anymore, I don’t take drugs, and I can’t just eat cookies even though I’d like to: one, I work out, and two, when I’m with my daughter — which is like half the time — I just have total down-time. I just focus on her and that’s really good because it gives my body a chance to detox from all the stress of days like today.</p>
        <p class="answer">Occasionally I’ll pull out the iPhone because I’ll feel like, ‘<q>I’m not really working if I’m checking email.</q>’ My daughter calls it ‘the hellphone’. She’s like, ‘<q>pay attention to me and put away the hellphone.</q>’</p>
		<p class="question">Let’s talk a little more about An Event Apart. Do you think you’ll ever host events in Europe?</p>
        <p class="answer">Every year we think about Europe and what we’re going to do about that. We’ve had people tell us, ‘<q>don’t you dare come to London — London is mine!</q>’ People do get territorial.</p>
		<p class="question">You’ve carved out your niche really well. As you say on the site it’s, ‘<q>a conference for people who make websites.</q>’</p>
        <p class="answer">We’ve hung onto that rather than start over-specifying it (‘<q>for people who make websites or apps or who do UX or content strategy or blah blah’</q>). What we’re trying to say is that we’re for the working designer and developer. They might not be the most amazing designer or coder in the world, but they want to do things right, they want to use semantic markup, they know how to use jQuery, they understand CSS, and they’re making the world a better place.</p>
        <p class="answer">There’s so much going on that’s backward on the web, but there’s so few of us. I mean, the people who are going to buy your book and the people who attend these shows or read these blogs are the ones who are pushing the web forward — and there are a lot of people who don’t know how to do that. I really love that we do that, and for me, my focus now is making the content that helps people do that.</p>
		<p class="question">Finally what’s on the horizon for Jeffrey Zeldman?</p>
        <p class="answer">Our next five A Book Apart books, my next blog post, the next Happy Cog site redesign, our next issue of A List Apart, the coming ALA relaunch, and a year’s worth of conferences. Boy, are my arms tired!</p>
