				<p>A six member band from North Co. Dublin, The Notas play expansive indie rock in the key of Wu Lyf with a dash of Foals. Cranking up the reverb on guitar and deploying electronics, the band keep the subtleties in the rhythm section on songs informed by their varying cultural backgrounds – French, Indian, Nigerian, Zimbabwean – a truly modern Irish band.</p>

				<h1>Where does your band name come from?</h1>
				<p>We had a lot of Spanish people and guys from South America around our area during the summer months and they use Notas as a slang term for being crazy! They called our guitarist Paul a “Notas” all the time and we thought it sounded pretty cool so when the awkward talk about what to name ourselves popped up we decided on that.  It was better then Chess Club Virgins, which was one of the names put forward first.</p>

				<h1>What was the strangest thing that happened to you in 2011?</h1>
				<p>When we first started as a band we never expected on getting this kind of attention. Most of us couldn’t even play an instrument when we first started so to come from that to being part of State Faces and getting your music played on Phantom is very strange.</p>
				
				<h1>What are your plans for the next six months?</h1>
				<p>Start writing more songs and playing lots more gigs. Hopefully even tour a bit around the country as we have yet to leave Dub   zy a festival by the time we’re 20 and most of us are 19 and going on 20 now so we’re hoping we can trick someone into letting us play one or two.  After that probably like to record another EP or even an album.</p>
