				<p>Stay open to being inspired across all of your projects. What typically happens is that you get truly inspired on one aspect of a project at a time. Act instantly on the inspirations that you have rather than letting mediocre tasks build up. Itâ€™s about staying focused in the moment and acting on inspiration. Your work will always come out better when driven by inspiration. Having a number of on going projects can actually be a great thing. When one project starts to feel stale, you have others to open back up with a fresh perspective and a clear mind.</p>
